The purpose of the equipment element is to isolate the text so that
it can be easily transferred in from the notes or out to a later edition.

<!ELEMENT equipment %inline>
<!-- 
The purpose of the file element is to allow the reconstruction of  
directory/name homepage/library/notebook structure.

<!ELEMENT metadata (metadata, file*)>
<!ELEMENT file (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST file
dir  CDATA #IMPLIED
name CDATA #IMPLIED

<!--
The purpose of the sort attribute is to allow for the sorting of the 
dt elements by a script. The dt element and the following dd elements
will be considered a whole for the purposes of the sort. In general 
there will be forward and backward sorts.
-->
<!ELEMENT dl (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST dl
sort 'forward' #IMPLIED

<!--
The purpose of the insert attribute is to allow for the insertion of 
an equipment entry (from, for example, notes) into the list at the given 
point. The 'equip' insertion will use the 'sort' attribute to determine 
where to insert the text.
-->
<!ELEMENT insert (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST insert 
type 'equip' #IMPLIED

<!-- 
The term element is being translated over in this section to an anchor 
and a reference. It should have a name attribute.
-->
<!ELEMENT term (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST term
name 
>
<!--
There is a close but not exact relationship between the anchor and the term
as the anchor is a 'short name' for the term. Since the anchor is also the 
sort name, it must be carefully chosen. In general it will be in lower case
and among the existing names will sort to the appropriate location.

<h3><a id="notes" name="notes"></a>An Annotated List</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="../art/intro.html" id="family" name="family">ART</a> - 
How to beautify the plain for little cost and much satifaction.
How to see the world of imagination in the space of a single image. 
A picture is worth the thousand words it would take to script it.
</li>

<li><a href="../biblio/intro.html" id="bibliography" name="bibliography">BIBLIOGRAPHY, ACCOUNTING, 
and CATALOGING LIBRARY</a> - 
<p>The skill of keeping all these books straight. 
The skill fails at 30,000 physical books for a single person. 
The fiction books are being tossed and replaced with electronic books.
The public domain non-fiction is going also. 
A favorite place to find out about books is 
the <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon Books</a>,
the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/">Gutenberg Project</a>,
the <a href="http://www.archive.com/">Archive</a>, 
the <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>, and 
<a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/authors.html">Online Books Page</a>,
for journals the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>
and for general searches the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> and 
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. For finding journals and books
locally use <a href="telnet://genisys.unomaha.edu">UNO</a>
and for inexpensive interlibrary loans use <a href="telnet://iris.unl.edu">UNL</a>.</p>

<p>The actual book catalogs are split between the library sections
such as this bibliography library section but
for an overview of the catalogs see <a href="../biblio/catalog/index.html">The
Book Catalog</a>. The web browser bookmarks are built from the library
sections and are used to update the library section but an overall view of
the <a href="../biblio/netmarks/index.html">bookmarks</a>
is available.</p>

<p>Most record keeping tells you what is at any point in time. Double-Double 
Entry Accounting tells you about the counter-flow and exchange of items, 
of the cost of every thing and the value of nothing.</p>

<p>The content of the libraries is primarily codexes but the text form can
also be a score, a script, a storyboard, or a choreography. 
The non-text forms seem endless but certainly embrace audio, images, and
video.</p>
</li>

<li><a href="../biology/intro.html" id="biology">BIOLOGY. AGRICULTURE,
ECOLOGY, and MEDICINE</a> - I like <a 
href="../family/biblio/house/biblio/vegies.html">food</a>
more than flowers, <a href="../family/biblio/house/biblio/fruits.html">trees</a>
more than concrete. Here is the secret of such beauty.</li>

<li>
<a href="../business/intro.html" id="business">BUSINESS
and ECONOMICS</a> - How to buy land for under a $1000/acre here in Wellington.  
How to hire an <a href="../cv.html">problem solver</a>.
Water is the stuff of life, buy your <a href="../business/biblio/woods dale/water/index.html">water
machine </a>here. While you are at it get several other interesting
<a href="../chemistry/biblio/novartis/index.html">chemical
synthesizers</a>.</li>

<li>
<a href="../chemistry/intro.html" id="chemistry">CHEMISTRY and BIOCHEMISTRY</a> -
For an unhurried look at erronia follow this to biochemistry. Chemistry
has been the love of my life since I was a small child. I hope to return
this love by creating a line of small chemical plants (desk sized), call
them personal synthesizers, that will meld computers and reactors to produce
cheap and readily available fine chemicals. When Microsoft kept changing the
languages too fast, I gave up on computing and went back to chemistry.</li>

<li>
<a href="../computer/intro.html" id="computer">COMPUTING and 
ROBOTICS</a> -
It should be possible to compute my way out of the laboratory. This should
make the rats happy. I found out that the laboratory was a rat race and
the rats were winning. Back to the linux computer world. If you cross a computer
with a bug you get a very cross robot. Now that the operating system has been 
settled, on to the language wars. Is C++ a general use language?
<a href="../computer/equip/computer_bookmarks.html">Computer
bookmarks</a>.</li>

<li>
<a href="../dictionary/intro.html" id="dictionary" name="dictionary">DICTIONARY, GLOSSARY, LANGUAGE, and THESAURUS</a>
- All the visible of our lives is woven from a tangled skein of words.
With the distilled liquor of our experience we can anoint the thread of
thought and tease away the snarls.</li>

<li>
<a href="../family/intro.html" id="family" name="family">FAMILY,
ARCHITECTURE, COOKING, EDUCATION, and PSYCHOLOGY</a> - How to build for $3/sq ft and keep the city happy.
Well, they aren't too happy. How to contact the government.</li>

<li>
<a href="../fiction/intro.html" id="fiction" name="fiction">FICTION (BOOKS) and POETRY</a>
- When all you ever wanted was to find one good book, is 16,000
<a href="../biblio/catalog/index.html">books</a> too many? 
The historical fiction is a distant image of our past seen through
the wrong end of a telescope. 
The science fiction is a window looking into the dark, showing shadows 
of our coming lives. 
The detective novel can lead us to understanding our true selves that 
we would hide in this age. 
Fiction over the ages leads us to the shifting image of our souls.</li>

<li>
<a href="../geology/intro.html" id="geology" name="geology">GEOLOGY,
PALEONTOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, and MAPS</a> - 
The buried volcanoes of Eastern 
Nebraska are being unburied here with all their associated mineral 
wealth. </li>

<li>
<a href="../history/index.html" id="history" name="history">HISTORY,
ARCHAEOLOGY, TRAVEL, and ANTHROPOLOGY</a> - 
<p><a href="../biblio/catalog/kline.math.html">The
zero</a> was introduced to Europe by a <a href="../biblio/catalog/g.html#gerbert">Pope</a>;
and forgotten for two hundred years. Did he teach <a href="../biblio/catalog/abbo.html">Saint
Abbo of Fleury</a> about the zero?</p>

<p>Can a <a href="../family/biblio/house/equip/house.biblio.genealogy.html">family</a>
learn from it's own history?</p></li>

<li>
<a href="../military/intro.html" id="military" name="military">MILITARY</a> - 
When you want to kill people and break things. </li>

<li>
<a href="../movies/intro.html" id="movies" name="movies">MOVIES and VIDEOS (LONG)</a> - 
See the world of imagination in time and space.
The script and storyboard can capture the flesh of the story.
The video can hold the spirit.
</li>

<li>
<a href="../music/intro.html" id="music" name="music">MUSIC and DANCE</a> - 
Hear the sound of imagination in time.
See the flow of movement.
The score will lead you to the reward.
The choreography will shape the flow.
Only the performance will tell if you can follow.
I like to play the recorder and sing. 
Nobody yells at the recorder.
</li>

<li>
<a href="../philosophy/intro.html" id="philosophy" name="philosophy">PHILOSOPHY, ARTISTRY, and LAW,
</a> - If you wish to rule others and create beauty you need to know the why of <a href="../philosophy/index.html#begin">it</a>. 
A cornerstone for current building is the libertarian party. </li>

<li>
<a href="../physics/intro.html"
id="physics" name="physics">PHYSICS, METEOROLOGY,
and MATH</a> - If I would build, I must know. Can turbulence be treated
as a temperature measured by the mass of particle it can suspend? Does
turbulence have a density, a heat capacity? Is there a conductivity? Is there an
increase as turbulence increases? An early worker with turbulence is
<person>Blinova, Yakaterina Nakitichna</person>. Can an inexpensive
<a href="../physics/biblio/nuclear/intro.html">nuclear reactor</a> be built?</li>

<li>
<a href="../radio/intro.html" id="radio" name="radio">RADIO and other voice AUDIO</a> - 
Hear the world of imagination in time.
The script will set the stage.
</li>

<li>
<a href="../religion/intro.html" id="religion" name="religion">RELIGION</a> - 
This is where I must justify myself. Of all the christians
out there, my heart follows along the line of hope spun by those who have
proceeded me as <a href="http:/www.anabaptists.org/">Mennonites</a>. 
Since I was discarded by my first wife, I am unacceptable to them. </li>

<li><!-- This section has been used as a starting point for the preface and 
intro of science. 2005-10-08 -->
<a href="../science/intro.html" id="science" name="science">SCIENCE
and ENGINEERING</a> - The general and the journal. For an analysis see
<a href="../science/index.html">The
Fundamentals of the Scientific Method</a>. What seems to be left out of
much scientific work is the application of the new understanding to some
real world problem. I would personally claim that 'good' scientific work
should be real world driven; that the scientific enterprise will be systematically
starved of resources until scientists look to sponsors in the world outside
of the government and education. The experiments kept here are
<a href="../science/biblio/notebook/index.html">on
keeping notebooks for the scholar, scientist, engineer, and computer programmer</a>,
<a href="../biblio/catalog/abbo.html">on
documenting nomenclature</a>, and <a href="../science/equip/standard/check.html">on
a checklist for systems</a>. These experiments are interrelated. The notebook
can be thought of as a "revision control system"
for a particular <a href="../science/equip/standard/index.html">scientific</a>
system. In contrast to the usual in programming or engineering, most scientific
work can be thought of 'reverse engineering' of a 'black box' to go from
an existing system to the principles of its operation at the best or to
the operation of some components of the system at the least.</li>

<li>
<a href="../space/intro.html" id="space" name="space">SPACE,
CELESTIAL NAVIGATION, and ASTRONOMY</a> - This is where I keep my dream
of working on the colonization of space. Just imagine the cDNA library
activated by weightlessness.</li>

<li>
<a href="../tv/intro.html" id="tv" name="tv">TV</a> - 
See the world of imagination in time and space just so long as you don't
take too long at it.
This allows that world in episodes.
The scripts, storyboards, and arc give a hint of the richness.
