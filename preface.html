This research is to get the most for the whole of the Woods Clan.
The key person pushing this approach is Jay Woods.  
The current head of the clan is Jay Woods. 
Those actively working on the project in addition are Dale Woods, Juel McDonald, 
Jonathan Woods, and Jason Woods.
Cathy Simon has made important contributions from time to time. 
Nicole Helling, Angela Fisher, and Myriah Yzguirre have started to
get interested.

At this level the project is being stated in terms of the 
capabilities of each member of the family and developed  
by an interest in the capability.
Each interest is realized as a series of projects. 
As each project (which leaves a notebook or book) is worked out a series of 
capabilities is improved and leaves each capability as the 
equivalent of a specialized library. 
As soon as subgoals as notebooks are reached a new one is started from 
the freed resources.  
Each new child is a fresh start and as such there is no limit except in 
the ability to cover all the ground that has been turned up. 
See the movie, Groundhog Day with its starting over each day, for the feel 
of this project.  
Although the family history in the Woods line goes back to William Woods, 
practically, this project started with Verle Woods. 
Ray Woods, his father, did not interact with his family much. 
Jay Orr Woods, his grandfather, thought in terms of passing on 
a complex skill, carpentry, with a great deal of success. 
We find no trace in the capabilities of the Woods family of William Holmes 
Woods with his newspaper publishing and doctoring nor of William Woods of 
farming.
We all are well known to not have any farming skills.
We have not even an idea of the skill of Frank Woods nor his wife nor children
beyond William Woods. 
Verle is the first in the family who taught his sons and daughter in 
terms of making a better life based on the history of the family.  
He is also the first to emphasize an extensive knowledge of the world around us 
as a means to improve our lives.  
The three branches of knowledge give us "how" and "why" and speak to 
"where" and "when".  
Dale and I have been able to achieve an independent lifestyle 
and a great deal of resilience against adversity by advance planning and 
avoidance of life destroying habits.  
We are having trouble interesting the third generation excepting Juel 
in the life-long learning all this implies but we are winning on the 
goal of attracting the women into our lifestyle.
Unfortunately Dale is isolated from his children.
The belief in lifelong learning is based on the first thing that 
God asked of us, to name things, and should lead to the 
the second thing, to be fruitful and multiply. 
The growth of the internet has changed this work from printed library 
of books centric to a net repository of projects centric.

Most of the research is being done in Garnerville (or Wellington), 
Omaha, Yakima, Spokane, and Las Vegas.
The records are stored in computers at 3935 Granite Way, Wellington, 
NV 89444-9320.
</p><p>
The funding is principally by Jay Woods, Dale Woods and Juel McDonald. 
We expect that it will be done our way. 
This is going to be extremely difficult as it involves bucking the course of 
American society which promotes the nuclear family.
Juel has been the most successful in bucking this trend.
Jay Woods can be reached at 3935 Granite Way, Wellington, 
NV 89444-9320, 402 408 6611.
