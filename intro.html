There are reasons for this work and limits on how the problem is to be

This is to lay the groundwork for the next section.

Subject: [Apothecary] Schooling (was: Re: Labels....)



:         I wish I could say I was excited about having to take chemistry as
:you are about wishing you'd had to. Hated it! Cut that class as often as
:humanly possible(eg). But really...you seem to know a great deal about it,
:certainly more than I retained from the class. Don't regret to much the fact
:that you never got to take it...more than likely if you'd of taken it back
:then, you probably would of hated it...now you study it because you really
:like it and want to. I think you are much more knowledgeable than people like
:me for example who HAD to take it.

O.K., I admit it!  I hated school and cut not only classes, but also
the whole day!  I think I held the school record for absenteeism!
After awhile, I didn't even have to bring "excuses" to school when I
did show up for a guest appearance.

But seriously, due to my love of knowledge (and hopefully wisdom), I
have self taught myself far more in the past ten years, then I could have
gotten from all which government funded education could offer, plus years
of college.

:       Now biology, anatomy and physiology...those are my favorite sciences:))

Me too, but my other interests are far too many to list!..  and what I don't
know, I have reference to check, and if I don't have a reference to check,
I won't stop until I find the answers I seek.  It's ironic, how unrelated
subjects of study can many times blend together, once one begins to really
do some heavy research.  Everything I've ever studied was a catalyst for
the next area of study, and it all seems to fall together.

A desire to be able to take care of myself and loved ones, as well as
anyone in need, using nothing but what can be found in nature, and that
is what brought me to the apothecary list.  In the event of a total 
collapse of civilization as we know it, I would want to be able to use
my knowledge and skills not only to survive against all odds, but perhaps
to make what's left of it a better place for all.  I cringe at the thought
of starving to death, or dying from a simple cold, because grocery or
drug stores  no longer existed!

<h3><a id="work" href="intro.html#work">The Earlier Work</a></h3>
<p>
A Life can be considered a Performance.
A performance can be recorded by Audio / Video.
The performance can be taught by example.
	Cross referencing is difficult without conversion to a vocabulary.
The performance can be symbolized in speech. 
	The speaker is no longer dumb.
	This reduces the bandwidth.
The speech can be further symbolized with ideograms or an alphabet.
	Now the speaker is literate.
	This reduces the bandwidth.
</p><p>
Although this collection of codexes organized into libraries is focused on 
books, it needs to be kept in mind that there many other stores of 
information: video, audio, Image, Script, Score, Choreography, 
Storyboard, and Manuscript.
	The complexity of formats is overwhelming until automated tools 
	for conversion between formats are available.
	It needs to be in both directions; for example from text to music 
	video and from music video to text.
		The text only gives a hint of the richness of the performance.
</p><p>
I started out by doing what I could within my knowledge. 
As time went on, working with Verle (my father) was possible. 
Like most kids, this was not my usual and personal choice. 
Like most fathers, this was his primary goal.
Fortunately, he could outthink me and gave me space to grow.
The family business was used to pull the family together as a clan centered
around Mom and Dad.
Cathy had left to be part of the Simon family and didn't really want to 
play with us.
By 1980 and the age of 38, running things was my job.
Mother was pretty much of a full time job for Dad until she died of cancer
in 1981.
By 1986 and the age of 44, the EPA and Burlington Northern Railroad 
had ruined the family business. 
Several ways around the failure had themselves failed.
The family split into groups centered around each of us children. 
</p><p>
Before the end of the 1980s the idea of applying the scholarly method 
to the family had been started.
The research goal is to get the most for the whole Woods Clan. 
The key person pushing this approach is Jay Woods. 
The current head of the clan is Jay Woods as no one else has volunteered. 
Headship is barely recognized.
Juel has indicated a strong interest in getting things to run her way.
	Bruce has not been interested in pulling her away from the family.
	Her birth father, William Holmes, is interested in pulling her away
	and it is funded by his wife, Judy Holmes.
Those actively working on the project in addition are Dale Woods, 
Juel McDonald, Jonathan Woods, and Jason Woods. 
Cathy Simon has made important contributions from time to time.
Angela, Nicole, Braden, and Mya are beginning to contribute.
	All are not trying to increase their contributions.
</p><p>
In contrast to almost any other project this one has no limit. 
As soon as subgoals as notebooks are reached a new one is started from the 
freed resources. 
Each new child is a fresh start. 
See the movie, Groundhog Day, for the feel of this project. 
</p><p>
There are several threads of interest that have informed what projects 
to take up. 
These threads form the basis for the capabilities behind each 
of the following libraries. 
The threads will be discussed as political requirements then the library 
capabilities as detailed requirements.
</p><p>
The net has matured to the point of keeping most of the information there, especially
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a>. 
The library is more for the family notes and readings. 
The actual works are linked to on the web.

Our design work is improving the closure on the usage of materials. 
We can use wood to store carbon and water where the carbon is a source of reduction 
and yet we don't need to create it. 
The trees do this for us. 
The oxygen in the atmosphere is a source of oxidation and yet we don't need to create it. The plants do this for us.
The fats and oils store carbon and hydrogen where both are a source of reduction and 
yet don't need to create it.
Plants and animals do this for us.
We could use metals and metal oxides for many purposes.
While plants gather many of these materials, this could be improved upon.

<em>James 4</em> is overstrong for this topic but does directly address it.
Wealth does no good if there is no guide to the appropriate usage.
		<ul><li>
A good place to start is to tithe for goodness and tithe for beauty.
		</li><li>
Collect figures on ones expenses.
		</li><li>
Categorize by the need satisfied 
such as children, food, shelter, health, transport and job.
		</li><li>
Rank by the ability to satisfy as a percentage of investment.
<pre>
expense - heat $140/mo
	proposal - insulate the house
assume a 50% reduction by investment of $3,000
	the $3,000 could cost $30/month at 1%/mo to reduce by $70/mo
</pre>
It is a good idea but perhaps not the best. 
Consider insulating part of the house with best return as part of another project 
		</li><li>
With the ranked list of projects do the ones that are the best going down the list.
		</li><li>
Do this while paying all loans that have a higher interest rate than the next 
investment.

When no money is owed and no investment in yourself makes better sense then exceed 
the tithe for more goodness and beauty.

accidentally). Maude Woods was an omnivorous reader. 
Ray Woods had read and acquired most of Zane Gray. This talent for 
reading has shown up 
in Jay Woods. He has read over 17,000 works of fiction. 
Fiction has the ability to lead a person to learn about the places and 
cultures that would ordinarily stay beyond understanding. And to understand
