	<h1><a id="title" href="index.html#title">Standard Project</a></h1>
	<ul class="protocol"><li>
This is the literature cited throughout the rest of the project 
notebook. 
Since the notebook is the equivalent of a published book or article, 
think of it as the citation entry. 
It is kept here in the bibliography section in date order (with a 
author letter and number code to resolve duplicate dates) by author by 
title. 
The viewing dates will give further clues to the user as to how new 
the references are. 
Monthly, there will be a pass made to restore numerical order using 
a bubble sort. 
The bubble sort is being used as, excepting new small projects, the 
bibliography is already in mostly sort order with the out of sort 
material at the end of the file.
The major subject classification can be found in the web linkage 
of the title (Title_w/link-to-physical-site) to an
electronic site for recording the storage of the physical document.
The detailed classification is ordinarily maintained in the 
Classifications and Suppliers section, will be added after the 
comments, and will have a web linkage 
(Detailed-classification_w/link-to-equip) to the Classifications and 
Suppliers section.
</li><li>
Subject by Author by Title - The literature is actually stored by 
<a href="WWW/index.html#contents">major subject</a> 
library by author by title (with article and 
preposition suppression). 
The reference citation will be in the bibliographic index for that 
subject with a two-way link by the citation date to individual notebook 
bibliographies.
For example:
	<ul><li>
A journal article useful to the "The Keeping of the Scholarly Notebook"
project and on philosophy will have the article stored in the PHILOSOPHY
capability (if a physical copy) or in the PHILOSOPHY Bibliography / author-code
/ short-title directory (if an electronic copy). 
	</li><li>
The article citation will be in the PHILOSOPHY bibliographic index
by author by title showing citation date (at a minimum). 
	</li><li>
The citation will be crosslinked by citation date between the PHILOSOPHY 
bibliographic index and the "The Keeping of the Scientific Notebook" 
bibliographic index. This gives a citation index in the PHILOSOPHY 
bibliography. 
	</li></ul>
Each reference will be kept in a
separate file: the major subject bibliographic index and the
individual notebook bibliographic index. This allows the new citations to be
added in date order at the end. A new title will need to be
inserted in the major subject bibliographic index author / title list and a
new author will need to be inserted in the author lists. 
</li><li>
Detailed Subject by Title - Much of the literature would have 
been cited in the 
<a href="../equip/index.html#begin">PERSISTENT OBJECTS</a>
section in a detailed alphabetic or hierarchical subject 
classification.
A new citation will need to be inserted in detailed subject / title 
order in equipment.
A new subject will need to be inserted in the existing subject 
classification in equipment. 
The citation will have a two-way link to the bibliography by the 
citation date and from the bibliographic index by the detailed 
classification.
</li><li>
Author by Title by Date - The author order will appear in the 
<a href="WWW/biblio/catalog/equip/index.html#begin">
Catalog of Books</a> with the link to the author individual entries 
suborganized by title. 
The new authors or titles will need to be inserted both here as well 
as in the main subject bibliographic index. 
The author / title lists will have a two-way link to the main subject 
bibliographic index above by the title in the catalog and author in 
the main subject bibliographic index. 
The catalog will also have purchasing sources, printing history, 
citations to works (which are not stored in this system) referencing 
this work and commentary on the author.

<p>
When I was about 12, Dad and I had gone up to Omak and had visited my 
Grandma Perry. 
On this trip I noticed that there were some books on a shelf in the 
Sun Room of her house. 
It turned out that they were books that had belonged 
to my dad and to my great grandmother Maude. 
I was given four of them: 
Hereward the Rake that ggm Maude had written her name in and at the end when 
she had read the book in 1947. 
(She died at 96 a year later of a kidney infection. 
It was said that she hated hospitals and wouldn't go to get the 
sulfa drug that would have cured her.) 
There was also two from the Ted Scott 
flying series by FW Dixon, Over the Ocean to Paris and Danger Trails of the 
Sky. 
The fourth book was Two Young Crusoes by MW Phillips. 
It was the story of a couple of boys camping on an island in a river 
for the summer, gathering pearls from freshwater clams. 
All four of these books have influenced my life heavily: 
fight to the bitter end because my ideas will win where I will not, 
stick with my base beliefs and be generous because anything else will 
destroy my beliefs, 
and last - live a life on a simple basis. 
It is fun and profitable to my spirit.
</p><p>
Dad wasn't too happy about this because of what happened when I insisted on reading 
them in the car on the way home. 
I was car sick until Wenachee before he made me put them away. 
</p><p>
My memory is faulty; keep a copy of every book and article I read.
30,000 paper volumes is too hard to move; go for digital copies.
Three types of materials are envisioned to be kept track of by a 
bibliography. 
	There is the usual book/report/article with author and title perhaps 
	distiguished by edition.
		The minor error corrections from printing to printing are not 
		usually of interest.
		It is usually expected that there are a lot of copies out in the 
		world.
		Rarely there is a book that is well known by title but the 
		author is unknown and anonymous will be used for the author.
	There is the journal or serial with publisher/society/compiler and title 
	with notes kept on the holdings by volume and issue.
		It is expected that individual articles are kept by author and 
		title and linked to the journal.
		Again it is expected that there are a lot of copies out in the 
		world.
	Rarely there is a single copy manuscript perhaps consisting of multiple 
	articles.
		This book will be treated as a single issue journal with the 
		compiler name of anonymous.
		Expect that such manuscripts will be in the Library of History 
		especially if they are of diverse classification, otherwise 
		they will be in a specific library such as the Library of 
		Religion.
</p><p>
Three types of documents will be kept here. 
The first is the normal material for the Bibliography Library, those 
books that are on how to keep a bibliography, books, equipment, glossaries,
plans, and other files/directories unique to the root notebook. 
	These are suitable for the root bibliography.
The second is a special file to open access news and journals.
The third is the soft link that leads to each of the capabilities (libraries).
	The Capability is being treated as the author and each library 
	soft link is to the the library itself  .
		The configuration files for the libraries themselves have been
		transferred to the plan. 
(The configuration files are created when <code>newproject</code> creates
the library.)
	This complication is needed because although the libraries should 
	be listed as notebooks in the Bibliography section rather than 
	from the root notebook, but for convenience, this is not true.
		Likewise instead of having the classification of the libraries 
		in the root table of contents, the classification should be in 
		the Equipment and Classification section. 
		Also likewise, the little writeup on each library should be in 
		the Abstract or Introduction section of that library.
