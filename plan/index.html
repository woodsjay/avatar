a project.	
	The anchor has been modified to simulate the description.
	The em has been modified to simulate the priority (term).

The above is true for all Future.
	Link the Future, Current, Completed to at least the library for the 
	project.
	Tighter linkage will depend on the existing projects in the library.
	Link the Future to the project which will release it.
	Put the tasks that are missing some resources into the Future.
	The writeup on each project should be placed into wikipedia.
		Check on any updates periodically.

Link the Current to the current task.
	If the task is on hold, the project is on hold.
	Put the held tasks that only need someone to work on them into the Current. 
	Put the held tasks that need other resources back into the Future.

Currently, projects are subdivided into three types:
	projects to resolve newly perceived possibilities,
	projects to fix existing structures (parts, methods) that are broken,
	projects to challenge existing structures for conformance to expected
	operation.
For a long time, only the first type of project was entertained.

The world as we know it is going to be simplified (collapse).

	a better power source is developed.
		Ontology recapitulates phylogeny (with simplifications) but with
		the complexity of all at once.

	Freedom will be gone between the end of the Obama's first term in

	Complex, monolithic systems are subject to catastrophic failure from

	Even in Omaha: finance (2008-10 - which happened and again in 2013),

	cities (Detroit, Cleveland, New Orleans - cities are going bankrupt
	more in 2013), 
	medicine (minor drugs 2011 and on going),
	sewer (2011-07 - flooding in Omaha), 
	and power (2013-08 - now happening as of 2011-09-01 in Texas but

	<a id="predicament" href="index.html#predicament">Predicament</a> -
Remember the distinction between a problem and a predicament:
http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2010/03/exergy-crisis.html
	A problem, at least potentially, has a solution; 
	that's what differentiates it from a predicament, 
	which cannot be solved and simply has to be lived with. 
	The depletion and eventual exhaustion of fossil fuels, 
	and the absence of any sign of an abundant high-exergy replacement 
	for them in this small corner of the cosmos, is a predicament. 
	The dependence on these fuels of most of the activities of daily 
	life in the industrial world is a problem, 
	because a great many of those activities don't actually need 
	anything like the amount of exergy we put into them.
		The high exergy is being used to overpower the lack of 
		intelligence in the controls.
		The following two articles outline why keeping our activities
		going suitably redefined is a problem not a predicament.

to Southern Cities when the free housing gets cut off.
	They will squat where they are until the abandoned housing gets torn 
	down.
Half of the housing in my neighborhood is vacant and maintained.
	The rents are high.
		This is probably a bubble because 
		there is are few Section 8 tennants being funded.

The biggest problem will be to stay out of the way of the death 
stricken elephants (governments/taxation/conflict).
	When the governments then NGOs fail, the family is left.
	Since I won't be going to space, the family will need to go to 
	the city center and be a better elephant.
		Play powerful foes against each other and wear the bastards down.
		Do this always in the context of offering them a better way.
		Let them make the mistake of choosing conflict.

City centers of <a href="index.html#economy">jobs</a> will intensify
with inhabitants and the 
undifferentiated suburbs will be abandoned (localization - mixed use 
condominiums). 
	There will be a 25% contraction in the economy by the end of 2010.
	Buy raw lots in the cities in 2011.
		Sprague and 24th is a secondary center worth buying into.

	The US will go from

	bubble/0081908.html">bubble to bubble</a> 
	selling each bursting bubble 
	overseas to all those who have stolen the bonds from the governments
	holding them.
	After the housing bubble (2007/8) there is the commercial paper bubble 
	(2008/9).
	Next will be the federal bond bubble (2010/11) and credit card bubble 
	(2009/10).
		They didn't happen because of support via the Fed with low
		non-competitive interest rates (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.

	The health business is a big bubble expanding on government money and

		It is ripe to correct because of better medication and use of computers.

	When the government is trying to do a good job they will be nationalizing

	Don't even think of investing in the stock market until the Dow hits

Solve problems with the longest time line that can be envisioned
(sustainability).
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_small_decisions
	The improvement is to cut down on having to revisit the problem.

<a id="multigen" href="index.html#multigen">Multigenerations</a> - 
It is possible to run such a household/family if the 30 somethings are 
in charge. 
	<ul><li>
	This increases the span of memory.
	It is in conflict with the urge of the young to establish their 
	own lives with the elders paying. 
		A recent example is the women having babies and expecting that
		their parents will pay all bills.
		The parents at least should have joint custody.
		Here is the opportunity for another contract, a parental 
		contract.
		If the woman is too young to sign a contract, is she too
		young to be endowed with parental rights and obligations?
		Should she be emancipated if the parental rights must be 
		hers?
	Be an assistant to the 30 somethings.
	Be a help (only) to the Tweeners.
		Let circumstances be the downer.
	When a proposal is made, use a dialog to resolve differences of 
	opinion and not a dictate from on high.
		When the situation is urgent, triage.
	</li><li>
	It is more difficult when it is separate households in the same area.
	It is hard to get buy-in.
	But separate households reduce conflict especially with Tweeners.
		H. Rider Haggard, The Swallow, "... nor did I wish to share 
		the rule of a dwelling with my own daughter ...".
		If it can be afforded move to the Six Acre Food Forest.
	</li><li><p>
	There is a basic conflict between the time needed for education and the 
	time needed in isolation to develop living skills and the time needed 
	for baby making and raising them.
		See Little Women for clues on pre-pubescent girls.
		See Altsheller Young Forester series for clues on pubescent boys.
		How about paying for "grades" in raising the babies (until grade 
		school) and for education? 
	</p><p>
	Include the military in the mix somehow for the aggressive and the weapon 
	bearing as education.
	</p></li><li>
	There will be a return to the baby making, home maker option for women
	(which will include the interior design, house building, still room, 
	nursing, educating functions). 
		But see military above.
			Not all women will fit the baby making mold nor should they.
			Many women make great soldiers.
				The marines are making a mistake in looking for warriors
				instead of soldier/marksman types.
	</li><li>
	I can't do this alone.
		Get other help as needed from special skills.
		Help others achieve their dreams via open science and engineering, 
		key project funding, and being a good assistant.
		It would be nice to handle the basic salary/insurance coverage
		for family.

	From the PC came the web came the crash of publishing came the crash
	in medicine because of dropping costs and bankruptcy of the 
	sources of money.
	<ul><li>
		Move stuff closer to the point of use.
		Have multiple supply lines not just the single most efficient.
	</li><li>
	Everything will be SATA6/USB 3.0 compliant.
		Cassettes are obsolete. You can't buy a player unless you buy a 
		1997 car.
		CDs are close to obsolete. Production is falling off.
			DVD re/writers are cheap and handle CDs.
		DVDs will be obsoleted in favor of streaming by 2011 since in 
		contrast to music DVDs are only viewed once.
			They will be replaced with 8 GiB SDHC/flash drives for boot.
			They will be replaced with web downloads for movies and data.
		Many of the separate applications will be on flash drives.
		The serial port, ps2, printer port, and floppy drive are now USB 2.0.
		Only the operating system will be on hard disk/8 GiB SSD/flash drive.
		The rest will be eSATA/USB external/internal drives.
	</li><li>
	Beware of unification that carries unsupportable requirements.
		An example is the bad handling of ink in an all-in-one printer.

	Don't depend on the web.
		All those .desktop links <em>will</em> get broken. 
		Use Firefox to save the page.
		Put the link into the subdirectory for the page.

    The web is changing toward consumer-oriented designs and

Switch from government control to 
<a id="contract" href="index.html#contract">contract</a> 
law 2011-12-27.
	One of the few good purposes of government is to enforce contracts.
		Contracts trying to bind the future are unstable. 
	<ul><li>
	Remember that a corporation is a creature of the state.
		The stock idea is still a good one. 
		Make it a contract.
	</li><li>
	Marriage for love and partnership is still a good idea.
		Make it a contract.
	</li><li>
	Help the children raise the grandchildren.
		Make it a contract.
	</li><li>
	Land is for food, housing, warmth, cooling, and a place to run a 
	business.
		Get around zoning by overlapping zones with the same building.
		Land ownership is still a good idea.
		Make it a contract.
	</li><li>
	Remember that a condominium is a government and can go broke
	ruining all within it.
	The maintenance and utilities must be local or negligible.
		Make the condomimium easy to disassemble.
	Or put on a 1000 year roof (like dirt).
		Garden on top of the dirt.
	No energy loss or gain.
		Heavily insulate the whole.
	No water leakage from floor to floor.
		Separate the ceiling from the floor above and drain any 
		leakage into the sewer.
	No water loss or gain.
		Use the roof to store water.
	No nutrient loss or gain.
		Use the roof to recycle the sewage and grey water.
	No property tax.
		Think Alabama.
	</li></ul>
</p></li><li><p>
<a id="assets" href="index.html#assets">Assets</a> other 
than cash are better.
Cash in the bank has all the stability of a snowball in the flames of hell.
	There is no safe, interest bearing investment.
		The investments must always be in income producing ownership.
	<ul><li>
Computerized markets can be used to make assets fungible.
	Consider using market indexes as a substitute for money: 
		NASDAQ (investment), 
		RICIE (energy),
		RICIM (metals),
		RICIA (agriculture) http://www.worldcommodityfunds.com/RICIA
			
	</li><li>
The government will work overtime to confiscate (tax) assets
including productive land.
	Make it look non-productive by the use of perennial (esp. tree) 
	crops.
	Make any building be underground or in the trees.
	Or make the construction of buildings so inexpensive that the 
	value is too low to bulk much in taxes.
		Build from dirt using a printer.
		Use the clay/hydraulic press approach.
		Use the acetate brick approach.
		Use the orthoclase to geopolymer approach.
		Cut any rocks with a hot knife or wire rope.
	</li><li>
Keep the land in small lots.
	Don't try to integrate them. 
		It looks less valuable to the city.
	</li><li>
Make it easy to disassemble and move.
	</li><li>
Accumulating assets rather than cash implies accumulating commodities 
(raw materials) that don't decay (such as metals that are normally 
exposed to the weather). 
	The other types of commodities and assets implies housing which 
	is conspicuous.
	</li><li>
If an asset is being purchased to cover a rare problem, get the least 
expensive possible. 
	</li><li>
Keep the minimum (reboot) necessities of life close to hand.
Use the 10% rule - Use an alternative for all the necessities on a 10% 
basis.
		<ul><li> 
	a loving wife (one per life) - mine is used up.
		</li><li>
	water (week) - drinking water - get set up to use rain water.
		</li><li>
	warmth (week) - get the garage insulated and clear the stove area.
		The woodshop solved this problem and is transportable.
		</li><li>
	rope and tent shelter (12 x 18 ft or 4 by 6 m) - Six Acre Food Forest.
		</li><li>
	medicine (1 month) - work with Betty - too late.
		</li><li>
	food (6 months during the winter) - the squirrels and rabbits 
	won't last long - By April 1 the larder should have completely
	turned over.
		</li></ul>
Beyond that is to develop assets that will carry you both for your 
working lifetime and then the convertible assets that will finish out 
life.
	</li><li>
Food must be available year round. 
What perennials have you done for the winter?
	(seeds, nuts, tubers, and roots).
	</li><li>
Medical is the biggest hole in the above plan.
	A 1,000,000 USD fund called "medicare" will solve that problem.
	</li></ul>
</p></li><li><p>
Stay away from 
<a id="taxable" href="index.html#taxable">Taxable</a> 
income (wages, rents, royalties) and real property.
	<a href="index.html#contract">Lease</a> rather than buy real property.

The new <a id="budget" href="index.html#budget">budget</a> 
for four weeks/month was:
	<ul><li>
	Household Expenses - 600 - Envelope
	</li><li>
	Health Maintenance - 100 - Blue Cross/Aflac Checks
	</li><li>
	http://www.drcalculator.com/mortgage/
	House Maintenance - 500 - Freedom Mortgage, American
		32,000 mortgage (house maintenance of 7,400).
			15,000 is original house purchase.
			9,100 is the new roof.
			$200/mo going to the maintenance.
			$300/mo carrying costs.
		When the mortgage is paid off the maintenance can't be 
		reduced.
			At 500/month to Freedom, payoff is 2017-12.
			The insurance is running the effective rate above 7.5% now
			and more later.
		It should be 1100 per month.
	</li><li>
	Auto Maintenance - 300 - Jensen
	This is equivalent to 30,000 worth of cars.
	</li><li>
	Tithing - 200 - 10% - Envelope.
	For family, theft replacement, and other charity work.
	</li><li>
	Research/Education/Investment - 200 - 10% - Check/Chase
		27,000 This is mainly NELNET school loan at $500/month.
			20,000 was used for living expenses during periods of 
			unemployment. 
			$50/mo going to the loan.
			$300/mo going to carrying costs.
		As soon as the 20,000 is reached transfer to else.
	</li><li>
	Utilities - 300 - Check
	</li><li>
	Else - 300 - Wells Fargo Financial
		16,000.00 Wells Fargo Financial.
			This is living expenses that went on credit cards
			during periods of unemployment.
			At 332/month to Wells Fargo, payoff is 2016-12.
			The insurance is running the effective rate above 7.5 %.
		The school loan will be transferred here when it gets down to
		20,000. 
	</li><li>
	There is no longer a job to fund the monthly expenses.

<p>
The <a id="eoel" href="index.html#eoel">End of Economic Life</a> for me is grim.
The budget shows that the outflow over the next few years is much 
larger than the income as even the short jobs that are now available
run out - 2012-03-02. 
	It will show by the inability to fund the maintenance of house and 
	cars.
</p><p>
In the 6 months before the exhaustion of the credit cards, declare 
bankruptcy, wear out the mortgage and then move in with the kids.
This can be stretched by low level work and sale of assets.
The children don't want what has been accumulated.
The assets won't sell.
	Make sure that the assets are zeroed out.
</p><p>
Remember that interest and return on investment are exponential if 
reinvested and expenses and wages are linear.
Remember that only my honor makes exponential work.

<a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4704#more">Less Becomes More</a>.
Many jobs that have never existed before will once again no longer exist.
But there will be a long list of new types of jobs.
</li><li>
Retirement, a phenomenon only a century old, will disappear.
Lifespans will get longer.
Death within a year of retirement will be noticed more and keep people 
from retiring.
Turn your body over for dissection and skip the funeral "tax".
</li><li>
Accumulating "wealth" will be out of reach for most people.
Accumulating working assets, however, will be more common.
The children will need to move into the home (and other assets) left by 
the old folks.
Current houses will seem like starter houses to the children.
The MacMansion house style goal of yesterday will be the underground 
(inside layer) house style goal of tomorrow.
</li><li>
Most children will no longer be able to attend institutions of higher 
education.
	But the equivalent and more will be available via apprenticeship, 
	books.google, scholar.google, open books, open engineering, and open 
	science.
</li><li>
Diseases and conditions that are easily treated now will once again 
claim lives.
	But most metabolic, viral, and bacterial diseases will be easily 
	diagnosed and cured (not simply treated).
</li><li>
Governments will solve the bubble problem by inflating the currency. 
	The inflation will hit hardest in non-recyclable and 
	non-substitutable expendables like fuel/heavy metals/food.
	The commodity market is back to summer 2008 levels.
</li><li>
Inflation in general is recoverable by better money.
	Resource exhaustion will kick our butt.
</li><li>
Build with metals to aluminum (as steel replacement), titanium (for high 
performance), and stainless steels (for tool steels).
	Wood will rapidly be exhausted in general and will become a 
	specialty product.
</li><li>
Money will be a big problem for us by 2010 (now 2012) because of the 
inflation in expendables and lack of work despite the social security 
income. 
</li><li>
There is deflation in income because of the lack of bargaining power on 
wages.
</li><li>
There is deflation in used capital goods because of the restrictions
being imposed on credit. 
</li><li>
The most inflation resistant approach is to provide skilled services.
	The computer field is over filled except in the latest buzz words.
</li><li>
Make the expendables and buy capital goods to reduce expendables.
	Don't hold on to cash or readily seized capital goods: land, etc.
	Land and etc. need to be encumbered with debt.
</li><li>
Don't buy land for the existing scenery, grow the good looking part.
</li><li>
Guerrilla gardening is the least expensive way to permaculture.
http://www.guerrillagardening.org/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_gardening
Tie up land by paying the back taxes (tax lien purchase) and planting 
trees. 
Knowledge to find minerals is even less expensive and is not a readily 
seized capital good.
</li><li>
Die old with lots of debt. 
	Give the children anything resembling family heirlooms well in 
	advance of death. 
</li><li>
Furnish a room with them at the children's home. 
</li><li>
There are two major sources of retained wealth: owning cheaper energy 
production and owning cheaper labor saving devices.
For the family it is: 
	1) solar and wood, 
	2) charcoal and liquids to chemicals, 
	3) wood shaping, computers, and metal shop, and
	4) permaculture.
</li><li>
Modify the trees for better harvesting.
	Try pollarding.
		How many trees die.
		What is the height effect on major cuts.
		What is the time interval to reestablish production.
	Try crossgrafting (tying trees, vines together).
		This will improve strength keeping the boughs from hanging down.
			Think pears.
		It will allow better fill-in between trees.
		It will allow skyways.
		It will generate 90 degree supports.
	Try skyways (paths from tree to tree at 12 ft intervals vertically).
</li><li>
http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4013#comment-346010
Oil, coal, and wood have gone through a factor of 10 inflation 
since 1999.
I think that 105 USD/bbl is a good equilibrium price for oil so long as 
usage declines a little each year and 1 USD/liter for gasoline.
	Once again it has been demonstrated that I can't predict interest 
	(and now oil and gasoline prices).
Oil, Natural Gas, and Electricity (in that order) are competing for the 
car.
2008-9 figures indicate that natural gas production is increasing 
strongly enough to replace oil for transportation and economically 
generate electricity. 
It will not mean anything to the family until 2015 when 5 year old 
used cars become available at depressed prices that use gasoline. 
The gas guzzlers are cheap in 2009.
	In 2011, the prices were up to avoid buying new cars.
	They were too old to use in the Clunkers program.
</li><li>
A factor of 5 inflation in expendables will hit by 2010 from 2000 and 
is currently running at 10% real inflation. (This is probably wrong.)
Oil is only responsible for a doubling of costs.
It is the institutionalization of the price of oil and the associated 
building costs that will get the factor of 5.
Labor based products will deflate in real dollars, construction, repairs.
Don't pay off any loans under or near 10% 
(Deed of Trust, School Loan, Wells Fargo Financial) 
but rather use the money to reduce expenses and increase tools.
</li><li>
Social Security will give COLA suitable for capital goods.
It will offset the fixed mortgage.
It will cover minimum rent/utilities/food/medicare but not home care.
</li><li>
When the work ends neither the mortgage nor rent can be paid.
When Betty can't keep house, I can't work and do it.
Move in with the children.
The children aren't prepared to do this (2009-10-11-12).
Jason is prepared (2013-05-01).
</li><li>
The credit cards should be cleared (23000 @ 1200/month - 2009 January) 
and social security money coming in by the end of 2010. 
	The loss of work has stopped this as of 2009-08-01.
		Done (2013-08-01).
</li><li>
Power production will be a big problem.
The United States will be less than united when power production comes up short by 2010. 
Nebraska is good on power production, some oil (panhandle and Falls City), wind, and Uranium (Chadron, and Falls City).
(The Falls City is now in doubt.) 
Nebraska, Montana, South and North Dakota are good on energy availability 
(coal, oil, gas, wind, and Thorium bearing granites and Uranium 
carrying shale) although they are all available at depth in the Forest 
Basin and Nemaha Uplift. 
There is a natural northern great plains group here: food, energy, electricity, minerals. 
</li><li>
Nuclear reactors with no exotic materials are readily built.
	Use excess neutrons to convert lithium to helium and tritium?
		Li^6 + n = H^3 + He^4 + heat
		Li^7 + n =? He^4 + He^4 + e- + heat
	Use a "columnated" lithium ion beam down the clear center of a 
	nuclear reactor as a rocket engine.
		What about beryllium dideuteride?
</li><li>
Let Kansas go South. 
Let Iowa and Missouri go East. 
Let Colorado, Wyoming go West. 
I've gone West to Nevada - 2013-06-01.
	So what am I doing in Indiana.
</li><li>
It is 50/50 that I will live to 83 (2025).
	My diabetes is killing me early.
As an aside that life is worth 
<a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/epa-value-life-environment-protection.php">6.9 M USD</a> according to 
the EPA 2008-07-11.
Health will be a problem.
Her osteoporosis and disintegrating spine will kill her earlier than 
2027 probably 2012. 
	I am full of sorrow, Flower, that I got that right.
		It was actually Oct 19, 2011.
My weight and diabetes will kill me earlier than 2025 probably 2012. 
	I got that wrong, now it is probably 2018 (2013-08-14).
Ride that bike.
	The bike has been fixed.
	The bike is abandoned in Rogers - 2013-05-01.
		There is a new bike at Nevada - 2013-11-01.
		But it needs to be assembled.
	Now I am Indiana - 2014-02-24.
		There is a used bike in Indiana - 2014-04-10.
</li><li>
Transportation will be in trouble by 2017 between old cars and 
gasoline availability as the US goes electric for transportation. 
	There should be good batteries by then to convert them to electric as
	the fuel/engines fail. 
		Tesla is on course to do this.
Electricity is at 1/10th the cost.
Natural gas is at 1/3rd the cost.
</li><li>
Likewise the other fuel/engines will fail (and have failed).
The equipment should be replaced with electric/battery versions. 
This is true for the chainsaw, lawnmower, bicycle, and airplane.
</li><li>
Covered storage is needed for the lumber and vehicles.
</li><li>
The Mexicans will have bought up all the 1998 cars this year - 2008. 
Next year it will be 1999 cars. 
	Three years have gone by - now I can buy a 1999 pickup.
		I bought an F-150 XLT 1996 4WD.
</li><li>
It would be better to think ahead and purchase a 
wrecked buick (1999) vehicles from the impound yard to use for parts. 
They need to be stripped to keep out of trouble with the city. 
Put them underground in a triple of cargo containers. 
</li><li>
Using a 6 ft retaining wall around the property will cut down on the 
ability of others to see something to complain about.
This will protect the children and pets.
Plant vines to the outside and trees to the inside and prickly bushes and cactuses on the top.
Use concrete rubble, gabions or containers for the retaining wall.
http://www.pavingexpert.com/featur04.htm#gab
</li><li>
An underground house needs to be built from cargo containers. 
To get around planning restrictions get a piece of land zoned for light 
industrial or business. 
The Six Acre Food Forest is the gathering point.
	Now it is East by North-East.
</li><li>
A root cellar for food storage needs to be put underground. 
Use a cargo container with an air inlet to keep it at or below freezing. 
Put it in upside down and slot the former ceiling to expose the soil.
</li><li>
Mya will not be moving here before 2012 (age 19).
</li><li>
The move to Spokane is good for Juel and Bruce, it may avoid the next.
It should give them a better leg up for the coming troubles.
	The inflation should remove the problems with the mortgage.
Juel and Bruce will divorce before the end of 2010.
	She is definitely making lemonade out of this - 2011-11-17.
Advise her to start a small business and/or get more education.
</li><li>
I need to have a way of replicating the problems.
</li><li>

This is a continuation of a Woods R&amp;E project from about 1955 on 
air purification run by Verle Woods.
It is now tied into the Polyurethane project and task.
Buy a commercial standalone unit for temporary room use.
	Check the filter that we do have.
		This should be purchased in Nevada.
Have a carbon scrubber to remove other air contaminents.
	It would be a good idea to drive it with a solar cell/battery 
	combination.
	The scrubber has been discussed with Les.
	It has been discussed with Calvin.
	It has been discussed with Jason.
		Use the combination solar/battery to drive the existing fan.
		It would no longer be necessary to use the pickup as the 
		emergency power.
		Be able to supply 1500 watts at 300 USD/100 watts or 4500 USD. 
		
This project has been sidelined because the polyurethane project is
sidelined.

that the windows based projects which work on masterie also work on

	At worst it will be necessary to run the software under WINE.
	However, the reverse is not true.
		There is no intent that linux based software also works
		on windows.
		However, there should be a copy of KDE running on windows so 
		that it is possible to go both ways.
	It is expected that many projects will start on masterie or messerie

The track (or powered carrier) is to automate the delivery of small 
quantities of parts and chemicals to the workbenches from robotically 
controlled stores in the basement and the reverse. 

The workbenches face the Northeast, East and South walls.
The robotically controlled stores are on the exterior walls.
Stock the shelves from the workbench.
Temporarily, sidings on the track can hold the items.
For 10K USD I can buy a lot of controllers and track.

Use web pages for communication, internally and externally. 
	The tracks are boxed and waiting next to the doorways.
		Install the tracks.
The reactors are an item and should be a deliverable also.
	Size will be a problem.
		Check if they can be an assemblable unit.
	It is expected that there will be about 50 types of reactors plus
	about 40 types of unit operations esp. for gases and solids separate
	from the reactors plus the Central Store.
		A simple Store would be a circulating track holding 
		a (self powered) carrier for each item.

	since it would be a pain (although not impossible) to keep the
	vehicle hard-wired to the switches. So, one Arduino could be
	monitoring the switches and sending an RF command to the vehicle
	Arduino based on the switch states. Something like that maybe?'

I expect to have an Arduino on the powered carrier (and think toy 
train on train tracks). 
The engine will be modified to accept power from the tracks and keep a battery charged. 
The battery will be used to run the engine and the Arduino. 
Each carrier will have been told where on the track to go. 
The carrier will be treated like the header of UDP message (where the chemicals are the message). 
The switch will be controlled by a cell (such as a fabber) 
and treated like a router. 
That means that the carrier must provide the header information to the switch. 
I have no experience on the RF devices needed to transfer the header.

As you can see from the above, I am trying to limit the 
interconnectedness of things. 
	Each piece does it's thing and goes on. 

This is a rewritten version of the above from 2009-02-12.
The rewritten version is of 2009-02-16.

The carrier has several non-standard features:
	<ul><li>
	<em>power</em> The power shall be buffered to overcome the 
	intermittant (sparky) current flow of the sliding contacts.
	(An ultracapacitor would be nice.)
	</li><li>
	<em>message</em> There shall be an information link to transfer a 
	UDP message body and header between the fabber/inventory cell and 
	the powered carrier. 
	(LED, sensor pair, one on carrier, one at fabber.)
	The header shall provide the destination.
	The body shall provide information on the item being carried (perhaps
	the null item).
	The null item information may be sync data.
	</li><li>
	<em>speed</em> The carrier shall be controlled for forward / 
	backward proportionally.
	This shall be in two phases: travelling and stopping at a precise 
	point.
	</li><li>
	<em>stop</em> The carrier shall have sensors to read stop 
	indicators as approached to trigger a stop.
	(LED, sensor pair on the carrier and on the fabber switches.)
	</li></ul>
All four functions need to be carried on simultaneously (4 Finite 
State Engines ?).
	<ul><li>
	The power function shall not interact with the other functions.
	(There is no assurance that power is available in the amounts 
	needed, especially at the stopping point.)
	</li><li>
	UPD shall be used because it doesn't have any error correction.
	(There is no assurance that the transmission is error free.
	It is handy if the message itself has consistancy features.)
	</li><li>
	The message header shall interact with the travelling speed by 
	providing a destination. 
	(There is nothing that assures that there is a destination 
	available. 
	The requestor for items better have this figured out ahead of time.)
	</li><li>
	The message body shall be received before the travelling speed can 
	be started forward. 
	(There is no assurance that the message ever completes.
	There needs to be a timeout mechanism as part of the item request.)
	</li><li>
	The item shall be part of the message. 
	(This ties the item to the message as a single transaction.)
	</li><li>
	The travelling speed shall be continued until a stop indicator is 
	read. 
	(No attempt is being made to correct for non-linearities in 
	the path nor other carriers on the path.
	This should be a function of the fabber switches.)
	</li><li>
	The stop shall cause the speed to drop to zero at a calculated 
	distance from the stop indicator. 
	(There is no assurance that there is a strong correlation between 
	the acquisition of the stop signal and the distance to the stop 
	point.
	This should be a function of the fabber switches.)
	</li></ul>
	
There is no provision here for errors.

Each box is specialized for a greenhouse, living (with water and w/o 
water), utility, office, or manufacturing.
	Utility can be air/water/HVAC/power/people handling.
	It can also be box sized elevators for cars/trucks/heavy equipment.
The boxes are stacked vertically, stacked horizontally to the North and slipped by 1/2 in the East/West direction in each horizontal stack.
Thus the stacks are oriented to the sunlight.
It is assumed that the construction is engineered to be in a pit sloped so that boxes are on a flat area.
	The pit can be sculpted to allow driving in and out of the lowest

If soil insulation or water protection is desired the extra stresses 
should be handled by exterior retaining walls as in boat construction.

It will allow the concept of 'budding' and specialization of new colonies to work.

The <a href="index.html#balloon">Hydrogen Balloon</a> is needed for 
straight lift freighting.
	Freight to the colony should be cheap using the balloons for lifting.
	It would be nice to make them autonomous.
	It will not be worthwhile to grow food in the colony but rather 
	lift it from the ground below.
	If food becomes a problem then resite the colony to a place not so 
	hostile.
		The land has been located in Deming, NM 88030, the Deming 
		Ranchettes.
		There is land available from 1 to 80 acres at 1K USD/acre.

Look farther west of Oklahoma in upper Arizona and New Mexico.
The New Mexico area looks good.
The wind picture doesn't look good inside the US.
It should be possible to have a stable colony in the Pacific.

This is part of the <a href="../family/biblio/woods jay arthur/sustain/equip/city_style">City Style</a> item.
Station keeping in the North Pacific Gyre should be easy.
The lack of the ability for self protection is a major problem.
	It would almost be best to have the first business be 
	arms manufacturing.
It would be a self-sustaining colony of 10,000 people.
The cost is based on the rule of thumb of 1000K USD per person for
city style infrastructure including land making.
100 USD/ft^2 x 10,000 ft^2/person for footprint (food, living, job, 
etc.).
Regulation is at a minimum.
	This should translate to more efficiency.
Transportation and country side are cheap compared to land.
There is enormous experience in shipbuilding. 
However, there is little that grows floating at sea suitable for 
construction.
	Cellulose, chitin, silica, lime, magnesia.
		Silica (diatoms) and lime (coral) are heavy. 
		They would need to be attached to floats.
	Chitin requires giant arthropods which don't seem to exist.
		What about sessile arthropods.
		What are the structures that tube worms make.
		How about sponges and barnacles.
	Cellulose at present requires trees and only mangrove fit the bill.
	Floats seem to be a necessary structure for any of this to work.
	Take a look at sargasso weed.
		It has floats.
	Is there a combination of reef building and floats that would work 
	out?
The use of cargo containers for structures and recycled plastic for 
cabling and surface treatment should reduce the cost considerably. 
It will allow the concept of 'budding' and specialization of new colonies to work as the sweet spot in the North Pacific is over 100 miles in diameter.
Also <a href="index.html#flotilla">new colonies</a> can be started at shore and slowly float to the gyre.
	They could be used for transportation to the gyre.
Solar power (including solar power satellite downlink), <a href="index.html#nuclearreactor">nuclear power</a>, saltwater mining (such 
as salt, bitters, magnesia), sea bottom building materials, agri- and 
aqua-culture will be the major economic activities.
It could be a way station for freighting to/from the US and Hawaii.
The <a href="index.html#wavebreaker">Wave Breaker</a> project is needed
as a preliminary step.

It is tied to Bigelow's <a href="index.html#hotel">space station/hotel</a>.

It will be a major source of minor elements for Earth.

http://potentiatenebrasrepellendi.blogspot.com/2008/11/nasa-tests-lunar-rovers-and-oxygen.html
The use of ion engines is a prime necessity. 
Garbage collection of 'in orbit' items by automated tugs is a prime necessity and a good first step. 
Space based refining is needed.
Neo Tracking is needed.

California has contracted for space power.
There is no project on microwave power transmission.
There is no project on laser power transmission for high power densities
that could be used by the Cloud Colony and other projects out in space at various Lagrangian points.
The battery makes for a dummy load if nothing else.

This is the most expensive of the projects.
	All the work can be expected to occur in the subprojects.
		Take a look at how ONeil got the design work done.
Because it can deliver cheap power and materials, it has the best 
returns of any project.
It would be a self_sustaining colony of 10,000 people.
Because of the enormous cost of freighting from the Earth, recycling is an overriding concern. 
Because the freight up is available only from the government and at 
enormous cost, space will be slow to develop.
	The projects are enormous in beginning cost.
	The freight will not come down until companies like Space-X and 
	Orion and projects like Falcon and Pegasus start delivering.
	Another problem is the designs of things for use in space are not 
	FOSS.
Freight down will be cheap. 
Anybody who is disatisfied with space can easily leave.
	Subsetting of the colony would be difficult unless the design 
	is multicellular.
		Multicellular is hard to spin as it implies axial symmetry.
		Two cans on a string revolving around a common center at the 
		middle of the string has multiple types of symmetry on 
		replication.
Techniques of recycling on Earth is a good learning tool especially for 
<a href="index.html#usedcathode">metallic junk</a> and <a href="index.html#permaculture">organic waste</a>.
	A robot garbage collector is needed for gathering up near space junk.
	It needs to be self powered and able to produce plasma from anything.
	The house based version should pick up anything non-metallic and 
	haul it to a central location.
		Wear metallic slippers.
		Put metallic guards around anything wooden.
		Develop a metal detector for arduino.
The <a href="index.html#spacepower">Solar Power Satellites</a>, <a  href="index.html#asteroidmining">asteroid 
capture</a>, agriculture is needed to keep the colony near self sustaining.
The <a href="index.html#cloudcolony">cloud colony</a> is needed for 
freighting to/from space. 
	The <a href="index.html#balloon">Hydrogen Balloon</a> project is a 
	good starting point there.
The <a href="index.html#hotel">space station/hotel</a> is needed for a starting point in space.

The goal is to grow the investment in property until he wants it.
The authorized investment at this time is lots at about 2000 USD per 
acre with no obligations other than taxes. 
The land is to be held in permaculture, investigated for minables,
and for sale.
By the end of 2013 he will permanently retire.
	I am moving there.
The money will be held in a interest bearing account with access to 
ready cash until needed.
	The interest rate started at 2%/month starting 2008-12-01.
	The interest rate was updated to 1%/month starting 2009-01-01 
	as the expensive credit cards were paid up.
		There is no ready cash of his - 2011-11-28.
When the properties sell treat as above.

Work with Dale on the solar power and wind power projects.
	Some stuff has come from Calvin on the solar power sun tracking.
		He has been emailed on part of the correspondence.
	Calvin is now gone - 2011-11-28.
	
Use roof fresnel (mirrored sheetmetal) to solar heat.
	solar tracking and steam generators replacing small gas generators.
	
Rebuild wind machines.

There are several approaches to a controller; the arduino is just one.
	arduino - running a finite state machine
	msp40000 - running a finite state machine
	pss8 - running a finite state machine.
	[pss10] - a home brewed controller using the rockwell micro800 and
	Primus style controller box running a finite state machine.
		It could also be one of the simple controller boards running 
		a rockwell style PLC emulator of the rockwell code output.
The reason for the finite state machine approach is the lack of 
interaction between the operation of the parts - 2012-03-02.

This is parent of the 
<a href="../notes/current/index.html#verle">Computer - Verle</a> task.
The verle machine is an experimental machine based on a 
laptop.
    This is to explore if the laptops are good enough to use for a 
    cloud server.
    It is in preparation for the headless laptops that are coming my
    way. 
        It is expected that the cloud will serve several purposes.
        One is to be a backup of each of our main machines.
        For that purpose unison will be used.
        Two is to be a substitute for access to the main machine when 
        we are out of pocket and using some easily portable machine.
        Three is to allow expensive software to be held to a single 
        copy in avatar and yet have multiple users in reality.
        The avatar will be run in the name of whichever dead family
        member was most noted for that usage.

This is a <a href="index.html#Current">Current Activity</a>.
This is part of the <a href="index.html#permaculture">Permaculture</a> 
project.
The task is in the 
<a href="../notes/current/index.html#swidden">Swidden</a> notes.
Started on 2012-02-20.
This approach succeeded the Wedged Permaculture method which was used
from 1997.
	The Wedged Permaculture method was never considered a separate
	project from Permaculture.
This was actually started in the fall of 2009 on Wirt but wasn't 
considered a project until now.
It was switched from moving from North to South to moving South to 
North the fall of 2011.
The swidden is an intensively cultivated area cut from the surrounding
permaculture area. 
	It approximates a line running East-West across the property. 
	The length East-West is about 120 ft at Belleacre.
		This has been going for 4 years to the South of the house for
		the 2/3 strip to the East.
		It has been going for 2 years to the North of the house for the
		1/3 strip to the West.
		This is peculiar because of the parking areas to the West.
		There is 50 feet North-South around the house not being used as 
		it is dedicated to flowers, house, shops, and parking.
		Even so the large non-food trees are being cut out and small
		food/flower permaculture items are being planted.
	The length East-West is about 240 ft at Lothrup-South.
		This has been going for 4 years on a hit and miss basis.
	The length East-West is about 120 ft at Wirt.
	The length East-West is about 240 ft at Lothrup-North.
	The length East-West is about 100 ft at Florence.
	Each of the areas are about 400 ft North-South.
		Use a turnover time of 50-100 years.
		Each year in the fall cut a strip 6 feet wide to the North of 
		the current strip.
			This is year one.
		Pile the branches on the strip from the previous year.
			That is year two.
		Pile the dirt one shovel deep from year one on the branches 
		of year two after mowing and leaf rakings are piled on.
			This should be composed down by the next fall as year three.
		Dig one shovel depth in year one. 
			This will be single dug.
			Plant to green manure as the soil will not be all that good.
		The years three, four, and five are planted using the four field 
		six greenhouse positions method from Coleman.
			This will require 30 ft x 18 ft greenhouse at Belleacre.
			Unless there is an outside source of compost, the soil
			will be exhausted by the sixth year. 
			It is expected that the permaculture plantings that have 
			been added in the third year will be up to size.
			It can easily be that the strawberry, rhubarb, asparagus,
			artichoke plantings will take over the fourth and fifth 
			year strips with no green houses.
			The biennial seed crops will fill in on the fourth year.
			
This is a maintenance project and will never be finished.
	This violates one of the assumptions about a project.
		Turn this into a yearly project, at least an annual task.
Adapting to the drier climate of Nevada has now been started - 2013-11-10.
	The basic assumption was that working organic into the soil was 
	a good thing.
		But this is called into question in Nevada because of the 
		lack of water. 
	Dust mulch over compost, both to retain water, seems like a 
	good idea. 
		Pine needles (duff) should be acting like a dust mulch and will offer
		visual contrast as well as pin down the dust.
		Get the duff by removing it from where a pine tree has been
		harvested.

The point of permaculture is to establish the techniques converting to a more useful form:
	<ul><li> 
	Capture the incident sunlight, air, and water.
		A minimum labor approach is conversion to vegetation and animals.
	</li><li>
	Transform the soil, rocks, vegetation, and animals.
		Bricks, lumber, food are examples.
	</li><li>
	Recycle any of the other materials that are created or enter 
	the real estate.
		The first step is conversion to a standard form of plastic, 
		glass, ingot.
	</li><li>
	Construct living space.
		Home, outbuildings, covered space, paved space, sheltered 
		green space.
	</li></ul>
The more useful form can be used on the real estate or be exported.
	It is handy if no more is exported than is received from the above
	sources.
The twin concepts of sustainability and resilience go together.

Most of the expense is the labor on the project of establishing the 
techniques at 250 hrs/year of heavy labor (which is labor that 
involves heavy breathing).
	The labor is available whether outside work is being done or not
	so long as the outside work doesn't involve heavy labor.
		I'm not making the goal on heavy labor because of necessary 
		trips on the weekends and the need to keep Betty company 
		overrides the heavy labor commitment.
		The budget has 400 hrs available for commitment.
		Unemployment will allow the heavy labor budget to be brought 
		current.

The return is the agricultural, silvicultural, and animal husbandry 
yield.
	The expected return will be for each of the projects below and 
	not accounted for here.
Modify the trees for better harvesting.
	Try pollarding.
		How many trees die.
		What is the height effect on major cuts.
		What is the time interval to reestablish production.
	Try crossgrafting (tying trees, vines together).
		This will improve strength keeping the boughs from hanging down.
			Think pears.
		It will allow better fill-in between trees.
		It will allow skyways.

It will be necessary to buy a few textbooks to make sure that what is 
being written is up-to-date. 
There are only two areas that I can easily write a book to use for 
teaching:
computing and chemistry.
The first computer book should be on <a href="../notes/current/index.html#foss">Apps</a>.
The first chemistry book should be a <a href="../notes/current/index.html#teaching">general chemistry book</a> that ties common 
experience to the understanding of chemistry. 
It should be the usual routine: foods, soils, rocks, atmosphere, 
oceans and major resources: ores, hydrocarbons, and salts tied through the periodic table which is based on covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds and in ionic media: acids and bases, and oxidation/reduction with oxygen-like-anode, hydrogen-carbon-electrolysis, and metal-like-cathode. 
This is part of the <a href="index.html#balloon">Balloon - Lifting</a>
project.
Do a lot of cross-over analysis in the periodic table like the below.
Consider two liquid media: oxygen dihydride at 0.1 bar (so that it is in water vapor only) and <a href="index.html#beh2">beryllium dihydride</a> at 10 bars (so that it is in bauter (a madeup term to resemble water with a b) only).
Consider electrolysis in bauter.
		Get the chapter outline done: air (nitrogen, oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide - 2nd generation stars; hydrogen, helium, boron hydride), water (2nd generation stars) and bauter (1st generation stars), earth (carbon, silicon, sodium, calcium), fire (combustion, life, ions), metal.
Consider the chemistry of the planets around first generation stars.

Now it is back to the Arduino. You're "think" is correct from my point 
of view. 
Each of the Arduinos will be assigned as a work cell and a powered 
carrier. 

The first two work cells will be chemical fabricators: the first one 
at the 100 ml to 1 ml batch size, the second one at the 100 microliter 
to 1 microliter batch size under microscope control when run manually. 
But the second is far in the future.

The Arduino will be set up to run the unit process robotically, 
simultaneously it will honor manual commands as well as provide 
monitoring data but not video to a PC. 
The video will be acquired separately. 
In the robotic mode it will be operating from digital and analog input 
and controlling with digital (and analog?) outputs through finite 
state machines. 
It should come as no surprise that I will use the concepts that I 
practiced writing controller software for steam sterilizers.  
Much of the code for sterilizers was taken up controlling displays. 
That will not apply here. 
The PC will handle that problem. 
The sterilizers were set up to only accept manual commands in a 
special mode. 
The fabbers will be able to accept manual commands at any time.
A big chunk of the communications will be accounting information - so 
many items having been received at the cell, so many items having left 
the cell.

Each fabber will have an IP address probably using UDP messages. 
I know there are net stacks for the Arduino but I have no idea at this 
point what hardware is being used. 
I believe that there is a net shield available.

Philip Mcintosh ndpmcintosh@mac.com wrote:
	How many total inputs and outputs do you envision needing?

I haven't a clue. 

There is a lot more to this than there is to a sterilizer. 
The biggest, most complex sterilizers have about 16 analog sensors and 
16 digital inputs. 
There are 16 digital outputs and no direct analog outputs. 
Two of the digital steam valve outputs are feedback controlled by 
pressure and temperature analog inputs to give an analog effect. 
To stay within the limits of the Arduino would require multiplexing. 
I suspect before this project is done, there will be a need for 
multiple Arduinos per fabber (but maybe not). 
I will certainly need pressure and temperature controls to 
transfer to/from the unit process and heat chemicals in the unit 
process along with positioners/xyz translators to move reactants and products from and to the power carrier to and from the unit process.

The following is a rewritten version of the above from 2009-02-12.
The rewritten version is of 2009-02-16.

The work cell provides the following services:
	<ul><li>
	<em>fabber</em> The fabber/inventory service. This will be left for
	a separate discussion.
	</li><li>
	<em>mover</em> The mover/interface service to get the items to and

	</li></ul>
	
The mover service has several features:
	<ul><li>

	(The communication with the PC is not being specified at this time

	<em>transfer</em> The transfer of items to / from the powered

	(An overhead crane would be able to move the items. 
	It is likely to be physically different depending on the physical 
	state of the item: gas, liquid, solid, etc.)

	<em>switch</em> The current carrier shall be allowed out 
	when the message is ready and any other carriers (while the current 
	carrier is present) switched out and then switched in. 
	Otherwise the next carrier shall be allowed in.
	(Run the traffic straight through. 
	Run the switched traffic around the section with the carrier at 
	the stop point.
	The stop indicators shall be upstream of the switches far enough 
	act as sensors to trigger the switches.)

	<em>command</em> The mover service shall accept a request / 
	send a completion from / to the parallel fabber service or PC.
	(UDP messages. 
	See messages for communication to the next upstream / downstream 
	mover service via powered carrier.)

	The mover shall interact with an incoming message header to 
	determine if this mover is the recipient of the message and 
	the mover is empty, then the item shall be transferred from
	the carrier. 
	Else if the mover has an item and this is an 
	empty carrier, then the item shall be transferred to the carrier.
	Otherwise the message is transmitted back to the carrier and the 
	carrier is released.
	(A null message acts the same.
	A null message is a good time to send out a sync message.)
	</li><li>
	Otherwise, this shall be treated as a transfer to/from the mover.
	After the move, the outgoing message is transmitted.
	(Priority shall be used to establish the sending then receiving of

	No attempt shall be made to effect a dual transfer.
	No attempt shall be made to have dual sites on either end.
	No attempt shall be made to have positioning error correction.)

	The switch is a pair. 
	The upstream switch sends carriers on a bypass when the critical 
	area is already occupied.
	The downstream switch merges in carriers on the bypass when the 
	critical area is not occupied.
	(The upstream sensors have shown if a carrier is on the bypass.
	The downstream sensors have shown if a carrier hasn't left the 
	bypass.
	When the reserved area is occupied and with a carrier ready to 
	leave while there is a carrier on the bypass, the leaving is 
	blocked.)
	</li><li>
	An empty area shall allow a command to the mover that an item is 
	ready to be loaded on a carrier. 
	A reserved area shall recruit carrier to accept the item.
	The mover shall transfer the item to the carrier.
	(This allows the message to be sent.
	This allows the area to be empty.
	There needs to be a timeout mechanism as part of the item transfer.)
	</li><li>
	An empty area shall allow a carrier to reserve it.
	The reserved area with an item on the carrier shall recruit the 
	mover to transfer the item from the carrier.
	An acknowledgement shall be transmitted from the mover when the 
	transfer is complete.
	(This allows the carrier to be released.
	This allows the area to be empty.

Publish the cores stored by the state.
Work on the new ideas in cores by splitting, polishing, doing 
reflectance studies with polarized UV-visible-near IR, 2.4 GHz

bulk analytical techniques).
	Check on the vacuum X-ray beam spot size.
The most detailed currently available for elemental analysis is 
la-icp-ms as a narrow channel method.
The most detailed possible for mineralogical analysis in situ 
currently is the polished thin section via polarized visible.
It should be possible to improve on this with fluorescence / 
reflectance / raman with angled polarized tunable laser / microwave
heating (or arcing for conductors all of which would show up on an

They will be found together from the few rare asteroid strikes of that 
composition.
	This theory was developed:
		because of the isolation of the 
		Black Hills from other mountain building regions in the middle 
		of a shield area otherwise stable for the last 2 billion years
		and later it was noticed that spodumene was common.
	Once the theory was in hand it required that Beryl and Tourmaline

The cost is about 100 USD/month in special foods (vegetables then protein rather than carbohydrates). 
	This is part of the Betty's home budget.
		Flower, I could sure use your help now.
The cost is about 100 USD/month paid to Jason/Brayden in yard work to 
replace other forms of exercise. 
	This is to be subtracted from the land costs.
	Jason and Brayden are goads/companions to keep me working.
	This doesn't happen when I am unemployed.
The cost of the B1 is about 1 USD/month. 
The cost of the B3 is about 2 USD/month.

	Insulin and insulin secreting drugs are not the answer.
		Insulin induces heart attacks.
		Drugs that increase insulin induce heart attacks.

or 11 mmol/L glucose in blood. 11x(12x6+12+16x6) = 2160 mg/L.
The reason is that the drug test needs to be valuable to the 
researchers.
	The drug works by simulating the hormone released by the sugar 
	hitting the gut.
		At the sugar levels in the bloodstream below the test can't 
		tell anything.
The meals are 'earned' when the proceeding blood sugar drops below 120.
A lunch salad is earned when the morning blood sugar is below 120.
A breakfast stir fry is earned when the morning and proceeding evening 
blood sugar is below 120.
A 100 calorie carbohydrate addition (prunes then a slice of bread or 
crackers) to the supper is earned (and a 100 calorie reduction in 
meat) when the evening blood sugar is below 110 and the morning blood 
sugar is below 120.
The meat can't be reduced below 4 oz but cheese and eggs count as 
meat.
	The protein has been checked on fish, pork loin, eggs, 
	shrimp, chicken, chicken breast, cottage cheese, cheese.
		They are equivalent in protein/oz with cheese, chicken breast 
		being higher and eggs being lower.
	The best cash values couldn't be checked for protein: heart and 
	liver.
		But they are likely to be equivalent.

Use the fried green tomatoes to fill in on the skillet.
	The only good cash values in the carbohydrates are flour 
	(pancakes) and mush.
Apples (fall) and sunchokes (winter) are available for free.
The goal is to get the blood sugar down to 100 at meal times.
	The usual large cup of coffee is with aspartame, 2 tsp 
	condensed milk, and mini marshmallows.
	There are no hunger pangs until otherwise stated.
	The coffee is still not justified on a sugar basis.
		It is believed that the vitamin B1 is protecting me against 
		nerve damage at sugar levels less that 150.
		It is believed that the asprin is protecting me against the 
		blood thickening at levels less than 150.
		It is believed that the vitamin K is protecting me against 
		over thinning of the blood at levels less than 150.
		It is believed that the multiple vitamins are protecting me 
		against the unbalanced and low calorie diet on a time period 
		around one month. 
		Reducing the weight to 255 was a major milestone.
		It took me back about 10 years (1999) since the last time 
		my weight was this low.
		Reducing the weight to 250 was a major milestone.
		It took me back about 21 years (1988) since the last time
		my weight was this low.
		Reducing the weight to 240 was a major milestone.
		It took me back about 30 years (1979) since the last time
		my weight was this low.
		The next milestone is 228 when Betty and I were married in 1969.
			This was reached. 
		The next milestone is 220 where I was when Betty and I met in

The current task on a digestive hormone drug test is <a href="../notes/current/index.html#diabetes">Diabetes</a>.
The test is over in 2013.
My blood sugar has been running about 150 in the morning for 3 months.
	I am finding too much food.
The blood sugar is still being taken twice a day but not recorded unless
it gets out of control (over 120 at dinner, 140 at breakfast with the 
new strips).
	It is getting out of control.
		No breakfast has been eaten for months.
		No lunch has been eaten for months.
	The "NO FOOD" diet has been resumed until the blood sugar gets down
	to 80 at dinner 2010-11-29.
	Also, take the full set of vitamins and minerals, identified so far
	as useful 2010-11-30.
		This solved a problem with a sore wrist/arm.
		rerun this as an experiment.
	I have definately been getting a hour of heavy labor per day.
		The Park and Recreation Code Enforcement has made a bunch of 
		work for me.
	OK, so every other day I'll have a piece of fish at dinner even if 
	my blood sugar isn't down to 80 but it is under 110 2010-11-30.
		RATS, it is still 156 2010-12-01 19:00.
		I can't bring myself to skip dinner.
	Consider drinking coffee in vegetable juice.
		It is not my best idea - 2011-01-03.
		It is getting worse - 2011-02-01.
	With Brayden here maybe some social control will ensue.
		That is happening.
		He is now hiding and that is gone - 2011-06-01.
	This is with my weight down to 235.
	My weight dropped to 232 in July.
		However, my back is bad as of 2011-07-21.
	My blood sugar is spiking to 200. as of 2011-08-30, 2011-11-06.
	I have been able to hold my blood sugar under 165 (except for 
	two episodes) for 3 months now as of 2013-02-03.
		The "Eat early and nothing more after 1 hour" rule seems to be 
		working. 
			The blood sugar was 125 at 8:00 on Saturday morning - 
			2013-02-09.
	The blood sugar is not going well here in Arkansas.
	Now that I am in Omaha, it is going better (staying under 160).
	Now that I am in Nevada, it is staying under 150.
		Except on 2013-07-01 where it spiked to 162 this morning.
		It is down at 144 at 13:00.
	My weight is now down to 230 to 235.
		The blood sugar has been as low as 118 twice in the morning.
		This is during the month of July and August.
	Come the middle of the month - rigorous dieting.
		My weight is now 229 and my blood sugar is in the 120-130 
		range - 2013-12-16.
		My weight is now 228 and my blood sugar is 115 - 2013-12-22.

This is to free up house space.
	The amount of shelves are 16 x 6 [inner 
	walls] + 16 x 5 [main and upstairs] = 100 + 80 = 180 linear 
	feet.
	At 10 books per ft that is 1800 books.
Of the 2,000 books or so that are left, this is a difficult job 
because I really don't want to.
	The first reason is that I can easily find what I want on the 
	shelf by a combination of familiarity with the spine and 
	location of the shelf.
		The shelf location problem has been eliminated by using the 
		library concept.
		The spine recognition requires the ability to have thumb images
		in the biblio directory which is supposed to be solved in the 
		scan task.
	The second reason is that the cost is closer to 20K rather than 
	10K USD for all the works.
	The third reason is the large amount of time to actually catalog the
	scan.
		The scan can be done elsewhere at half the price.
	The FICTION has been eliminated. 
	The HISTORY has been eliminated excepting SCA.
	The PHILOSOPHY including MATH has been eliminated.
	The SPACE has been eliminated.
	All public domain books have been eliminated.
		There are many web sites that carry the books.

This is doubly exponential. 
It pays for itself by the reduction in shelf space needed.
In addition it is self reproducing when placed on the web when working 
with data, public domain, and CC license.
Those books which are in copyright and are needed should also be scanned.
The notes are to be scanned, esp. business papers.
There are about 1000 books at $5/book.
The books need to be converted to an electronic format for more compact storage.
Google handles the indexing.
The scanning is a series of page images.
	It needs to use OCR to get a series of page[no].txt files.
	The text needs to be post processed to be converted to a single 
	text file.
The <a href="../notes/current/index.html#pda">pda</a> task is the ebook 
viewer.
	It would be handy if the pda had a program to take text hints and

The following is an interview with Wilbanks:
	Ellen Duranceau: I understand you majored in Philosophy as an undergrad. Is there is particular philosopher’s work that you draw upon to support his efforts with ScienceCommons? 
	Wilbanks responds: “Philosophy has turned out to be directly relevant to our work at Science Commons - the principles behind the Semantic Web are essentially the same as those investigated for centuries by philosophers from Hume to Plantinga. In terms of influence, I could list a dozen philosophers that have influenced one element or another of our work. I know that Thinh Nguyen, our counsel, is deeply influenced by the work of Daniel Dennett (and everyone involved in science should read Dennett’s “Darwin’s Dangerous Idea” http://library.mit.edu:80/item/000718338). But I’m probably most influenced overall by Thomas Kuhn, who wrote “Structure of Scientific Revolutions” http://library.mit.edu:80/item/000800381 and introduced the idea of the paradigm shift....[T]he core arguments about how ideas emerge in science, are beaten down by the establishment, and have to force general changes in the overall knowledge structure of science - those arguments resonate deeply with me. And a huge part of what we’re trying 
to do at Science Commons is enable the overall acceleration of the cycles Kuhn describes, to make it faster and faster and faster for ideas that deserve to emerge to emerge, and to let as many people into the process as want to be there.
	This mix of accelerating research cycles and increasing participation in science through lowered barriers means that we get more revolutions, faster. It’s one of the only non-miraculous approaches available to us. We need theoretical breakthroughs in fields across the sciences, we need more revolutions, and Science Commons is trying to deploy the infrastructure of knowledge and that can make those revolutions easier to achieve.” ...

This has been part of the 
<a href="index.html#permaculture">permaculture</a> project since the 
beginning.
After most of the available lots were purchased in 
<a href="index.html#belleacre2013">Belleacre - Up to 2013</a>, land around Adams park was 
being watched.
	There were two areas being considered: 36th Street adjoining the 
	park and another area to the West along Corby.
		Someone else started buying up the Corby land away.
		It was also small parcels.
	The railroad property along 36th Street became available.
		I bought the 3 acres for 1,000 USD in a bidding war.
		Since then, all the land has been accumulated there along Maple,
		Binney, Wirt, Spencer, Lothrop, and Bedford.
		The city is refusing to sell the parcels as they become 
		available as of 2011.
The <a href="../notes/current/index.html#fiveacre2008">Five Acre Orchard Cleanup</a> is a task.
Use the adverse possession method to acquire more 
<a href="index.html#emptylots">land</a> between existing lots.
	This is no longer active.
This is to increase the food supply and land value. 
Clear space for berry and tree transplants on the borders, esp. South:
Maple, 36th St, 36th Ave., 37th, 38th, Wirt, Spencer, Lothrup.
Maple is done.
Interplant English and Black Walnuts on the North.
It is to have the emergency underground shelter.
	It is to be constructed as a [1/2]x[12]x[24] 
	<a href="index.html#wedge">LEED Wedge Building</a> project.
		Build it in 6 foot sections.
		Do the North section 12x6 section first.
		Start work when it cools off for pleasant working in the 
		evening (in the fall, 2009).
	This is no longer active.
		
The current maintenance tasking is the 
<a href="../notes/current/index.html#fiveacre">Five Acre Orchard 
Transplanting</a>.
	Start work after the first frost in the fall, 2009.
	Back to this in spring, 2012.
	This is no longer active.
	
It is also to supply building materials for the 
<a href="index.html#shedroof">shed roof</a>.
	This is no longer active.
	
With the move to Nevada only projects started by others will be 
initiated. 
	There is already many plantings that will continue to grow.
		Michael will be paid to mow along the road.

It is a <a href="index.html#Current">Current Activity</a>.
This is following up on a thought experiment of several years ago.
<a href="../../../public_html/family/biblio/woods jay arthur/house/equip/power/conductor/superconductivity.txt">High Temperature Superconductors</a>.
Updated on 2009-07-08.
This is part of the <a href="../physics/equip/electricity/">Electricity</a> item.
The thought was that if there were natural superconductors they would 
be found in black sand samples.
The light element (lithium, beryllium, boron) sands would be interesting
also.
They could be found by cooling the sample to liquid nitrogen temperatures and
using magnetic levitation.
If the superconductivity is reached in the presence of a magnetic field, the 
superconductor should also have a magnetic field. 
A search for natural occuring superconductors turned up nothing.
http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:sSOX-VH7QkUJ:www.sciam.com/article.cfm%3Fid%3Diron-exposed-as-high-temp-superconductor+natural+%22high+temperature+superconductor%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=us
There is a cheap kit available to test these ideas.
<a href="http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp?pn=3053602&bhcd2=1216997200">Kit, Complete Demonstration, Superconductivity</a>. 
The concept is being explained as a phonon-electron spin pair phase change.
For high temperature superconductors a new explanation is as a 
magnetic dipole-electron spin pair phase change.
		There should be a piezioelectric-electron spin pair phase change.
		It should show up in piezioelectric semiconductors under pressure
		separately from the phonon type.
		Two to try are ZnO and CdS.
		Hutson A R &amp; White D L.; Elastic wave propagation in piezoelectric
		semiconductors. (1962)
In a highly pressurized gas, piezoelectric crystals should become charged dipoles, orient in an electric field, and coellesce.
Locate a natural superconductor in sand samples from carbonatite 
formations.
Look in thin sections.
	The superconducting grains should turn black.
Look at polished core flats.
Look in organic thin sections.
Establish the formula for any sand grain found.
Add a high pipeline pressure test to the superconductor black sand test.
Consider looking for superconductors when under pressure from a pair of 
charged capacitor plates.

This is a subproject of the <a href="../family/biblio/woods jay arthur/biblio/house/index.html#begin">LEED Wedge Building</a> project.

The <a href="index.html#ceiling">Main Floor - Bedroom - Ceiling</a> 
project is part of this.
The <a href="index.html#cistern">Cistern</a> project is part of this.
The <a href="index.html#mortgage">Condominium Mortgage</a> project was a first attempt at the financing.
The <a href="index.html#deck">Finish Deck</a> project is part of this.
Set up the property on N 23rd as a residence/land/business condominium. 
My interest is the further development as an income producing property.
This won't happen until someone else runs it.
Jonathan is the only one likely if I can get him to town.
It is not practical to add any more underground parts of the house 
because of the pit required to keep the cost down and the undermining
of the current foundations.
The cost will be to bring it to the [1]x[2x3(1)]x[1x3] building 
from the [1/2]x[2x3(1)] building it currently is.
The current [1/2] is the garage.
The current [2x3] is the three floors of the house.
Expansions after that will be paid for out of profits.
Use this as a layer of libertarian government.
This needs to be set up as a 
<a href="index.html#landcontract">Land Contract</a>.
This has no way of working until the house is up to my standards.
This pays off by being able to make a more fluid market for apartment 
style housing close coupled with gardening and business for those who 
are interested and nothing but a bedroom for those who are not.
Make it loadable <a href="index.html#containerhouse">modules</a> in a 
post and beam steel or a wood structure boxed for strength at minimum 
weight.
Acylated wood sheets into plywood lasts like teak.
	Wood fibers are acylated.
		Check on a method to determine the level of acylation.
Consider making acylated wood fibers into transparent paper into 
transparent board.
Recruit successful renters.
Set up a profile for condominium owners.
Make complaints about the property a liability of the complainer if 
taken out of the condominium.
The upscale version [1]x[2x3]x[3x5]x[4x7] is 1000K and would need to be 
at the Five Acre Orchard. 
Keep the condominium fully mortgaged.
Make a market in LEED condominia (as per the assumptions on a condominium).

The house maintenance was last tasked on <a
href="../notes/2012/08/index.html#201208010330">2012-08-01 03:30</a>.
<pre>
<a
href="http://www.1031exchangelowdown.com/2007/01/77_surefire_way.html">
home improvement list</a>.
<a href="http://www.buildingwithawareness.com/index.html">home
building</a>.
</pre>
Our list of projects for the house is:
	<pre>
Expand the bathroom.
	Flower, now that the "clutter" is removed from the bathroom, 
	the hamper fits.
		This has removed the pressure to renovate the 
		bathroom.
Redo the kitchen.
	The kitchen has been reorganized.
	The drawers have been fixed.
	Flower, now that the "clutter" is removed from the kitchen, 
		the pressure is removed to renovate it.
Do the first floor deck.
	The South section is done.
		Flower, the porch looks much better now.
		It solved a lot of problems with the winter weather.
	The materials have been purchased to add the trellis
	to the South.
		This is done.
		Also the roof access has been blocked with trellis.
	Five trellis panels need to be bought and cut for the second floor
	deck. 
Wall the east of the first floor <a href="index.html#deck">deck</a>.
	Roof the deck.
	Do the other three walls on the deck.
	A permit will be required.
	
Put in a new <a href="index.html#containerhouse">staircase</a> to the 
North between all three floors so that the interior staircase can be 
abandoned.

	</pre>
The children's maintenance list is:
	<pre>
Finish the trim in second floor bedrooms and common room - Jason.
Rework the tile and trim in the 2nd floor bathroom - Jason.
	</pre>
Their project list skips right to:
	<pre>
Expand the bathroom on the first floor with especial attention to 
ceiling, floor, and shower - $4,000.
	This doesn't save money.
	It would only pay off if the house is sold.
Refinish the kitchen cabinets, etc. - $4,000.
	Close in the West window in the kitchen.
		Done - 2011-05-24.
		But not finished.
	Watch for inexpensive cabinets to do the kitchen temporarily.
		The Ikea cabinets might be worthwhile.
		There are good sets available on Craigslist about once a month
for 
		$1,400 2011-02-01.
	Use the first floor deck for a mud room/laundry room.
	It would only pay off if the house is sold.
		</pre>
		The children have missed the critical 
		fan cooling, and wiring maintenance problems.
		There is a problem draining the upstairs plumbing.
		There is a problem with the winterization of the water line to 
		the south.
		See <a href="index.html#pluginwiring">Wiring - Plugins</a> 
		for the wiring problems.
		However, it is not sustainable when the government collapses.
	Would Jason be interested in running this place?
		Not according to him.
	Maintain the windows to the North.
		The putty wasn't used because of the cold.
		The painting wasn't done because of the cold.
		The broken window wasn't replaced because of time constraints.
		Work on this some more in the Spring.

There are money problems since the maintenance doesn't save any money 
until the item is unusable.	
	Work on this some more when Jason is available in 2012-June.
	Help Jason on his stuff.

That has the task 
<a href="../notes/current/index.html#housing">Sustainable Housing</a>.
Because the cost is so high, it will be subdivided and the most 
cost effective will be done first.
The benefit would be 4000 USD/yr on the current combination of 
wood stove (1,000 USD/yr) and propane (1,000 USD/yr) plus 2000 USD
of additional fixed installation for wood stove and propane tank.
Close the loop on power, HVAC, and insulation for the property.
This turns into a series of projects.
	<ul><li>
	<a href="index.html#superinsulation">Superinsulate</a> the house.
	It would help if it were not so expensive to do this as an 
	afterthought.
		It could be done as an additional layer of foam as the walls
		are clad inside with wood paneling.
		Remove all the North facing windows and double pane all the 
		South facing windows.
	</li><li>
	Upgrade HVAC to Geothermal HVAC.
	The preliminary for this is the 
	<a href="../notes/current/index.html#coring">Core Sampling</a> task 
	to get a well to water.
		A ditch witch doesn't work in this soil.
		Assume water is at the level of Walker Creek (5120-4980=140 ft)
		or down 140 ft. It will cost a couple of thousand to reach it.
		According to http://www.mcdonaldcarano.com/read_news/view.asp?ID=77
		if the water is reinjected, it does need to be permitted.

	Solar and Wind generated electricity with 
	<a href="index.html#batterymaintenance">power storage</a> project
	and <a href="index.html#windmine">Wind Energy</a> projects.
	Many solar cell/light combinations have been purchased to keep

Started on 1945.
Finished on 1953.
Written up on <a href="../notes/2009/11/index.html#200911230330">2009-11-23 03:30</a>.
This was started by Verle Woods in 1952.
	He had noticed in 1945 when at Stanford that some (colloidal) clay 
	suspensions didn't settle.
	In the 1950-1 he spent a lot of lab time getting DDT to suspend in 
	a mixture of oil and water where the oil was to dissolve the DDT
	when heated and then help hold it up when cooled.
	He used saw blades in place of a pump impellor to break up the 
	clumps of DDT crystals as they formed. 
		A working formulation was achieved in 1953.

	Split the Family library to create an art and music library. 
	The art library will be pictures of art works such as paintings and statues. 
	It will also include famous and pretty buildings. 
	Where the art work is taken from book illustrations they will be cross referenced.
	The movies are all from books and so go into the fiction library. 
	The music will be both recordings and sheet music.
	It will be indexed by composer in biblio and performer in equip.
	It will also include musicals and videos associated with music esp. collections.
	The basic format is the instrument/midi standard.
	It has become clear that pictures of people work out better when stored in the 
	notes and linked to the individual people.
	This is because the files use a thumbnail of the picture.
	Now if it were only possible for book directories to use a designated image.
		Add a color png of the cover and spine.

Started in 1980.
It might be worthwhile to convert the catalog to be inserted into each of 	libraries directory structure 
and <em>index.html</em> to hold notes and significant dates.
	Don't build the elaborate index.html files currently being used for biblio.
	
	Try to handle all the cases in three ways: script, perl and C.
	The first step in the database for the book catalog is to build a
	database with two fields:
	<pre>
		file name 	[string]
		file		[binary blob]
	</pre>
	This would give a database where the files are alphabetized as they are now.
	The files are all html files organized by author in either html or text form.
	
	The book on PERL DBI has been received.
	It was error checked against the O'Reilly web site.
	Now read the book.
		This has been abandoned.
		Updated 2008-08-06.

There is a large section in wikipedia on the scientific method that needs
to be incorporated.
	A link was used from the library biblio to the scientific method biblio
	for Whiteside's paper on writing chemical research papers.

The openSMILES approach is a good way to linearize chemical equations.
Learn it.
Use InCHi for the indexing and not for chemical equations once structure past 
the first level of InCHi is needed.

An example is:
<pre>
HNaO + ClH > H2O > ClNa + H2O (Use this form because there is no confusion.)
NaOH + HCl > H2O > NaCl + H2O (Don't use this form because a direct lookup with
	InCHi could have been used rather than a conversion to InCHi and 
	then a lookup with verification against the canonical openSMILES name.)
</pre>
I could lose this argument.
	The first level after InCHi=1 has been done in chemistry/equip/.
		There are problems with polymers and alloys.
This has been replaced with <a href="index.html#chemscript">Chemical Scripts</a>.

Last tasked as <a href="../notes/2007/12/index.html#200712010330">2007-12-01 03:30</a> openSMILES.
		The problem of the output of the chemical script has been considered.
		The conclusion is that the third of the triplet is the output.
		Consider how to get from the output to the usual form of the output.
		An example is:
<pre>
NaOH + HCl = NaCl + H2O		(25 C and 1 atm using 1 gmw of each per liter of water )
NaOH + HCl = H2O = NaCl + H2O	(H2O is the name of the reaction) 
								(with the conditions as above.)
"HNaO + ClH" = H2O 				(will output "ClNa + H2O" from the H2O script)
								(concentrations should also be available)
								(correcting for solubility as other reactions.)
</pre>
		This looks like the duality between formulas and values in spreadsheets 
		or values and units in physics is appearing.
		More elaborate scripts will do the conversion of NaOH(s) to water 
		solution, the use of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the evaporation
		of the water to get the salt.
		Alternatively it can handle stuff as ions.
		For the full use, both need to happen in stages.
		This was discussed with Dale.
		He will not get excited until an application is available.
		Try the solution mining application.
		The use of the &amp; causes trouble use the = instead.
		See how that interfers with InCHi.

		One would expect that additional CO2 would depress solubility.
		It will only work out if the CaCO3 ionizes directly to CO3-- and
		CO3-- is of lower concentration by the conversion to HCO3-- by the 
		ionization of H2CO3 to HCO3- and H+.
		Yes, the pH IS more acid by a concentration of a 1000 which should reduce the concentration of CO3-- by a 1000 which should increase the solubilization of CaCO3 by a 1000.
	Table data indicates a solubility of about 1 g/liter at 10 bars and a pH of 
	5.3.

		This is probably too low to be useful by a factor of 10.
	A chip was pounded off what looks like limestone in the yard to the north.
	A subgram fragment was tested with vinegar.
		It bubbled.

	A 4.1 gram sample was weighed out that would fit into the neck of the

		It will be left for a week.
	On addition, the bottle promptly foamed over.
		It is likely that the limestone (cracks?) catalyzed the loss of the CO2.

	The experiment was rerun using 1 liter of seltzer water (nothing beyond

	A small amount of charge was lost when the cap was removed.
	The sample was handled in a manner that stopped any significant loss of

		<pre>
The Seed Savers Exchange (SSE) has hit a rough patch in its operations. 
The founder has been kicked out of the organization that he founded. 
It is much more probable that the organization won't be very organized in the 
near future. 
The SSE is too important to allow the work that it does to lapse without replacement of at least the exchange function as exemplified by the SSE Catalog.

The exchange function can be easily implemented with current technology using a combination of email, blog, and wiki. 
An existing example of much of the background information presented in the 
Catalog being created is Wikipedia. 
An entry for the Baldwin or Woodpecker apple can be created that is the equivalent of the background information that is in Catalog for Apples.
The starting point would be the entry for Apples which already exists:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples
There is currently a nice table in a linked article:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apple_cultivars
in which the Baldwin entry leads to:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_(apple).
The wikipedia has the latter entry marked, 
"You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."
There are two sections of the Catalog that would be replaced:
	Contributors - instead of physical address use an anonymous email address
	as in craigslist. The email will be forwarded to the contributor's email 
	address.The contributor's email portion of the exchange function is in the email list:
		seed saving and exchange <seedsavers@lists.ibiblio.org>
	Plants - for each type of plant (Apples) and variety (Baldwin) the contributor
	would enter the information for their contribution to the Seed Saver Wiki (SSW). This wiki entry would contain their own information about what they were offering or wanted along with their anonymous email address (such as NEWOJ1@lists.ibiblio.org). 
The actual catalog entries would be used by going through the plant then variety
lists looking for an entry of interest.
When one was found, the user would send an email to the anonymous email address (such as NEWOJ1) which in turn would be sent to the actual email address.

The wiki and the blog would make it easy to create and enhance background
information on anything from amaranth seed storage training videos 
to xerophyte cultivation in rain forests. 
We can really spread out and make it easier to train ourselves to conserve and 
enhance the rich heritage still available to us.
		</pre>
		This has been emailed to the seedsavers list. 
		It was well received.
	The seed saving entry in wikipedia was enhanced to include permaculture 
	crops.
		This will be the entry point into wikipedia.
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation
		Now make sure that there are seed saving instructions in each of the 
		topics of the seven topics.
This was marked completed because of the lack of activity.

set containing itself as a member.
	That example is blocked by the definition of set.
		The morality resolves down to:

The blackmailer is responsible for his actions.
I am responsible for my previous actions (over which I am being 
blackmailed).
I am responsible for my current actions (which is to see to the

This is part of the <a href="../science/biblio/woods jay/notebook/index.html#begin">laboratory notebook</a> project.
	The new feature of naming tasks was added to notes/plan.
	This is a working out of detailed requirements from the political requirement.
	This ties in to the project software, <em>TaskJuggler</em>.
	This consists of:
	<pre>
		adding an anchor for each active task in notes,
		adding an href in the current field of the page directory to the same anchor,
		for each month add an href to the last month in which the task was active,
		figuring out what to do that will allow going up the chain of months,
		adding the same anchor in the plan which will be carried forward thru 
		future, active, and finished.
		adding the equivalent href in the each of future, active, and finished header
		in the plan.
	</pre>
	This allows jumping to the current monthly tasks directly from the page directory.
	This allows tracking the current tasks backwards in the each of the monthly notes 
	by day (not by task directly).
	This allows tracking the task forward to the current monthly task through each
	of the monthly notes with the newest day linking to the next most current month
	from the <em>continued at</em> spot.
	Alternatively the page directory can be traced directly for the task.
	This allows tracking the current task to the active plan from the oldest day entry
	at the <em>continued from</em> spot.
	This allows tracking the finished plan to the most current of the notes.
	This allows the root and library notes to be segregated by task with a 
	post processor to be inserted in a project notebook.
	This also allows the project notebook notes to be merged by library or root 
	into a notes summary.
This is now a maintenance task and not a project.

	The following was an email to ChemSpider.
	
	After finding out that Amazon actually has chemicals on Monday, I ordered one just to see what happens (some Potassium Iodide to use in the sea salt that I buy - which is not iodized.) Your daily blog arrived and reminded me that I haven't given back. Since my favorite reporting language is PERL I hunted up what is in CPAN for querying Amazon - that led me to Net::Amazon - Framework for accessing amazon.com via REST at http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Amazon/lib/Net/Amazon.pm and http://sourceforge.net/projects/net-amazon/ using the Amazon Associates Web Service via the API Version 2008-03-03 at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/2008-03-03/DG/. Here in lies the first sticking point. If this program can't query Amazon without paying a charge, the project falls to the ground. 
	
	In answering your question the sample chemicals I located by browsing around indicate that the name 'ProductName()' and product description 'ProductDescription()' have enough information to identify chemicals and sometimes pick up the CAS but that there is no field that specifically points to chemicals. 
	
	This means in the worst case a pass over all industrial and scientific supplies items (0.4 million) as well as health items ( 1.5 million) at one per second or a month of about 5 KBytes per item (ASIN) or 10 GBytes total. By looking in the product name (title?) filtering against a list of chemical names it shouldn't be too bad. The load on my cable would be minimal at about 5 KB/sec. The match against the list of chemical name fragments of about 20,000 would be the first project I've had that will actually stress any of the 8 computers that I have lying about. 
	
	The first step will be to download some items and do the matching. I've got a small database laying around somewhere to develop the list of chemical name fragments. Inorganics will be the easiest to find which most likely won't excite you people. The trivially named organics will be the hardest to identify. A couple of tests should identify ways to speed up this whole process and provide you with your test list.
	Get an identifier.
	
	Write a program to pull in all items from a node.
	
	Run a test to pull in a page of items from a node.
	
	Salt it with a chemical item.
	
	Run against a fragment list.
		I've lost interest in this because amazon doesn't have much of 
		interest.

There is a couple of ways to make money on futures.
One is to lock in good prices by issuing future contracts.
	Trust of the counter party is currently in short supply.
	Uses of the money are hard to justify right now.
		Futures contracts on money is something that makes sense at the
		100K level as that is my income per year.
		
		This allows access to tremendous supplies of money by selling
		future production.
		Always keep in mind that the future may have a lot of inflation
		so that the inflated cost of production may bite.
		This can be offset by buying options on the <a href="http://www.infinitytrading.com/treasury_bond_futures_options.html">future money</a> for 
		the future cost of production.
		This can be used to fix the inflation rate on savings.
		Since we are holding about 1M USD in assets and 100K USD in debts - 9 
		100K contracts should work.
		
		Are the oil companies selling future contracts?
		Another is to assure supply by buying future contracts.
		Could the government by buying future contracts of oil instead of
		buying current oil and storing ensure the oil supplies.

		This involves too much money for currently available finances.
		Return to plan - future $1B.
Future contracts have no future in hyperinflation.

April has asked for help on a game she is playing where she has good evidence
of cheating.

The problem was discussed with April.
<pre>
	Download all cards.
		It was pointed out that there are two ways that the program she is 
		using could be used for this purpose:
		If all the cards are sent to the program in advance of the play.
		Analyze the TCP/IP datastream with wireshark.
		Check for encryption.
	Download others cards on demand.
		If the program has special commands to see all the cards.
		It is likely that:
		Shills are being used. (The company can't afford to lose the money.)
		Disassemble the code.
		A special program is being used by shills that gives the full set of 
		cards.
	Baysian analysis.
		A baysian analysis should show if cheating is going on.
			For showing cards calculate the odds of winning.
			For my hidden cards and the showing cards calculate the odds of winning.
			Use the bets to inductively assign the odds of winning to the 
			other hands.
			Keep records on what was actually done to estimate the strength of
			the player and find players with advance knowledge.
</pre>
	It was gotten to work on mugsie.
		But the commands to save the packets to a file could not be found.
	It is to be saved at the end of the session.
		Try not to run it for a couple of days without a filter.
		Analyze the current session and build a filter.
		The status was covered with April.
	April was emailed a solution for the problem.

It has been 4 years since the last refinance of the house.
The intent is to keep the house improving and then increase the 
mortgage.
The natural limit for this task is the current refinance of the house 
including the money borrowed on the Wells Fargo Finance loan. 
Throw in Compass if possible.
	According to Bruce this is likely if the appraisal holds up.
The intent is to pay off the Compass credit card as fast as possible.
The next intent is to pay off the school loan as fast as possible.
Use the maintenance and projects to increase the value of the house.
Use the valuation to locate and value the projects.

		The power pops off after a couple of seconds.
	This is acting like a breaker.
	Try disconnecting the power supply to see if it is using too much
	power.
	
This is probably not worth it. 
	Strip the computers.
	Abandon windows 98SE. 
	Focus attention on getting the scanner and printer working on 
	mysterie.
	
It is now a backup for scanning.
	Try to substitute the later Windows 98SE machine (mushie-temp) for
	mushie.
		It is faster and should end up with more hardware.
		A copy of the install CD/ROM has been recovered and can be used 
		to reinstall if the current hard disk is toast.
The mushie (formerly stupid) machine is a backup used to run 
the old printer/scanner.
		
Because of the age of the equipment and that it is a backup and that 
the temp computer is non-working, the printer, the mushie computer, 
and the mushie-temp computer have been junked.

Fix the hole in the ceiling in the bedroom.
	Cherry stain was purchased.
		Fix the switch on the table saw.
	A new saw blade was purchased.

Last tasked on 2009-06-01.
She has an appointment with Wilson at 2009-05-27 10:20.
	The sutures were trimmed back.
		No significant problem was found.
	
She had trouble breathing as of 2009-05-28 12:00.
	The temp was 98.4.
	The O2 was 94.
	
The physical therapist is coming as of 2009-05-29 at 13:30.
	He looks like a good guy.
		This got tangled up in Betty going to the Hospital at 13:30.
	She was admitted and in her room and settled down at 20:00.
		There is no problem found other than trouble breathing which is 
		made to vanish with O2.
	It stayed this way on 2009-05-30, 31.
		The echogram didn't show anything.
	The physical therapist called and said he would get back to me on 
	Tuesday.
		I am to meet the Doctor (Paul Gesonten) on June 1 at 12:00.
		There is medication to remove the low blood pressure and speed
		up the heart rate.
	This has the appearance of cross controlling her other medication.
		Consider using O2 instead.
	The Doctor showed test results that she has COPD with a PFT of
	37%.
		This explains a lot.
		It doesn't explain why Wilson neglected running a PFT.
	Another Doctor (Penn) collected the first of three samples at 
	18:30 for a contagion test re MRSA pneumonia.
	She is happy on 2009-06-02 17:15 while we ate dinner.
		The results of the sample weren't received.
	The sample is negative as of 2009-06-03 01:00.
	She came home after work.
		The medications at Baker were picked up.
		The nebulizer from Kohls was delivered.
		The bed was raised by four inches at the head.
	She is fine as of 2009-06-04 07:00.
		Her temp at noon was 98.3 F.
	She doesn't feel well enough to eat breakfast as of 2009-06-05 07:00.
		There was no temp.
		Measure O2.
	I drove her to get her nails done and to buy shoes on 2009-06-06.
	She had trouble sleeping the night of 2009-06-06.
		
The key in the COPD is the PFT test.
	Check on whether this can be run from home.
	The rest of the treatment such as drugs are only available 
	through the doctor.
		It should be possible to come up with O2 someway so that she
		can rest easily.
	More exercise would be very helpful.

		Add drives to the linux boxen as useful.
		The <a href="index.html#woolerie">woolerie</a> box disk is 
		too small at 80 GB. It needs at least 120 GB to hold current

		Replace the disk with a minimum cost drive for the GB size.

	Don't rush this as woolerie is a high end machine.
		I am one good machine ahead.
		It would replace winerie.
	The new machine would replace wyerie.
	The machine is mosey for a high end windows machine.

This should really be in social security but this is the most likely

It turns out that the red-blue paradox is used to explain (if not to prove) Goedel's Theorem.

This is to avoid problems with the city over cars.
It was also to be a starting point for the garage space. 
This is a hack on the <a href="index.html#wedge">LEED Wedge Building</a> construction to get something started.
It should be 6 inches thick with rebar with the top at foundation height.
24 x 24 x 1/2 x 2 x 64 / 2000 = 24 x 24 x 64 / 2000 = 20 tons or 20000 USD.
Get four 1 ft by 48 ft (48 ft support - 24 above ground + 24 ft foundation) 
ferroconcrete columns installed first in the ground to ground level.
This is way overbuilt to allow for the subfloors to be mined out 
(hydraulically) after the fact.
Skip over the entrance to the basement. 
	Get the fence out of the way first.
		The fence has been removed.
	This conflicts with the 4 floor stairwell project.
		The stairwell to the 2nd floor shouldn't go in until the 
		the 2nd floor is rebuilt for entrance to the stairwell.
		Check out how the exploratory well fits into this.
		If the cased hole is in the interior corner to the 1 x 1 column
		it would allow access to the hole.
	This conflicts with the 5 floor tower.
		The overbuild with hydraulic mining allows for the subfloors.
		The pit needs to be dug first.
		The foundations for the existing building will need to be 
		extended down for two floors.
	All the above conflicts still with the thick slab.		
The car port was built instead.

This is a <a href="index.html#Completed">Completed Activity</a>.
This is part of the <a href="../family/biblio/woods jay arthur/house/index.html#begin">On Engineering the Perfect House Version 5</a> project.
This will be about 200 sqft.
Most of the materials will come from the 
<a href="index.html#fiveacre">Five Acre Orchard</a> project (posts, beams, poles).
It will cost about 5 USD/sqft.
It will be necessary to buy the plastic sheeting for the roof.
It pays for itself at about 1 USD/sqft/year for storage space, 
redirecting the rain from walls and foundations to the grass and 
plantings, and a dry area out of the rain and snow.
This is to increase the area out of the rain between the alley and the 
house.
It will provide water to plantings at the dripline. 
It will check out the idea of using sideways installation to build roof 
plants, especially moss.
	That was switched to the South shedroof because the poles were 
	too crooked for sideways installation.
It is also the first cut of a green house.
	There is still several house work problems (Jason's list) 
	to solve first such as <a href="index.html#deck">Deck</a>
	and <a href="index.html#roof">Reroofing</a>.
		It is being pushed ahead because of equipment loss and rot if 
		not done.
		Too late on the rot - rebuild it from the foundation.
		Some of the poles are worth keeping.
		Use aluminum sheet to go from the original roof to the new roof.
	This has been solved differently by leaving a gap and using a gutter.

It is related to the <a href="../../../plan/index.html#condominum">Condominium</a> project as a test of the roofing.
Reconstruct the shed roof to repair the rot and to make it sturdier.
Put the plastic on with the groves running horizontally rather 
than vertically on order to trap leaves and get xerographic plants
growing on the roof.
	All the 7 ft poles have been cut and are on or near the frame.
		They still need to be notched to go into the 2x4 hangers.
		Use the crosscut saw and wedge for the notches.
		The first and second bays are done.
	Place angle braces at each end of the beams and posts.
		Three more are needed.
	Use aluminum sheet to go from the original roof to the new roof.
		It is cut.
		Screws are needed for the aluminum (and later for the plastic).
		The screws are purchased.
		Consider using metal on the roof instead.
	Get the plastic up. 
		The ends of the plastic must be supported somehow to stop wind 
		damage and flashed to stop rot, probably an additional pair of 
		poles.
		It is done.
Jason is needed to continue this.
	It is likely to happen starting 2010-03-01.
		It was done with Dennis.
		The horizontal didn't work out because the roof was too uneven.
	Run the poles vertically.

Air Exchange Ventilator - 500-1000 USD
Heat Recovery Ventilator
Whole House Ventilator
Broan, Fantech (http://fantech.net/), Venmar
As the house is better sealed (or underground) the exchanger is needed
to remove CO2, water, methane, H2S, and other air contaminents and 
bring in O2. 
	During the winter it needs to preserve temperature and moisture.
		Consider trapping the water and R/O it into the air.
		This is to get rid of gasses and dissolved organics.
		Consider using the ceiling to floor pipe for the input air
		and having the output at the floor level.
	It would be a good idea to drive it with a solar cell/battery combination.
		Check out the relationship between fan/power and heat 
		exchanger size.
	It would be nice to focus on the bedroom and bathroom and kitchen.

The tapered section is asparagus, grapes, saskatoons, peaches, 
apricots, filberts, self seeded crab apples, and cherries.
The West border is planted to tapered section selections.
The volunteer trees in other areas are managed for poles.
	They need to be cut in the spring so that the stumps will coppice.
		Put dirt on the stump.
There is the usual temporaries of berries and flowers.
It pays off in transplants, food and timber.
Over the month of August a water leak developed near the street on 2730 
that makes up the acre around my home. 
	I was lucky that a M.U.D. crew was working a block away. 
	They came over, inspected the problem, and called it in. 
	I am not so lucky that the leak is in the water cutoff valve (and I 
	don't have service to that lot because the house is gone). 
	That means I get to pay for the repairs which must be done in 10 days
	(or at least have a repair crew on hook).
It is ready for the winter

This is the maintenance on the pickup.
The allocation is too small to keep the vehicle in good shape by 
appearance.
It must be kept in good shape mechanically.
This vehicle is used for transfers of dirty materials, heavy portable 
equipment, light trailer towing, and emergency power generation.
Replace the pickup in spring of 2010.
That will require moving (or replacing) the high capacity alternator.
The towing package will also need to be replaced.

The muffler is going.
The auto-on for the headlights have failed.
The alignment of the headlights is bad. 
	It is not easily repaired.
The left hand turn indicator doesn't work right.
	It is not easily repaired.
The windshield wipers don't work right.
The truck bed is rusted out.
The fenders are heavily rusted.
	They could be built of fiberglass.
The overhead covering is falling down.
The towing electrical cable has not been checked for functionality
since the pickup was purchased in 1997.
There is no cover for the winter.
The front bumper is bent up from an accident.

Replace the pickup with a 1999 S-10 pickup in the spring.

There is no cover for the winter for the pickup.
	Purchase it in May to use for both the pickup and the Bravada. 
	
The towing electrical harness should be replaced.
So should the bumper.
	
The left hand turn indicator doesn't work well.
	The left turn doesn't indicate unless the headlights are on.
	The left turn doesn't restore.
		This is likely to require removing the front panel.

The truck bed is rusted out.
	Order in the bed the first month that there isn't a Jensen bill.
		It isn't before January.
		It should be after repairs to the Bravada or Buick.

The windshield wipes don't work right.
	Right at the moment they are working.
	They stop working in rain storms.
	
This vehicle is used for transfers of dirty materials, heavy portable

Rain barrels are available at 1.25 USD/gal.
	I was able to get several for .20 USD/gal.
Get a cistern installed underground. 
	This will stop algae growth.
	A slightly acid water should stop pathogenic bacteria.
		Raise the hot water tank temperature to get pasteurization.
	Run the water through a filter.
	Use a pressure tank and a piston or gear pump to get line pressure 
	from solar cells.
	Put a break in the city water line.
The upscale approach is to use a cargo container.
	That would be 0.20 USD/gal. for the 48 ft-aluminum.
		It doesn't count the hole.
		It also offers the possiblity of dual use.
This is 
	to increase the irrigation water available during the summer, 
	to have grey water for the house, and 
	to act as an emergency water supply. 
	The garden in 2008 is using 50 gallons/week when there is no 
	rain for a twelve week interval.
	The household grey water is about 200 gallons/week for dish 
	washing, showers, cooking, and clothes washing.
It should be at least 500 gallons. 
The tank should be about 500 USD installed with pumps.
The hole to put it in is what will cost.
The value of the water being replaced is a maximum of 500 USD/year.
It would be nice to move water from the rain barrels to the cistern to cut down on the trash that would be transferred. 
	Figure out where it is to go.
	Check on using garbage cans in trees replace the cistern.
	Check on using a well replace it.
	Use garbage cans as a temporary replacement and to get the plumbing 
	figured out.
	The pond is a pain.
		Control the mosquitoes.
	The pond is gone.
		The EPA did it.

Use rain barrels at the four corners of the house where there are 
short downspouts.
The water is for the house plants and for the zone 1 gardens.
The house plants need about a 4 liters/week. 
	A single 55 gal. barrel would hold the freezing season supply.
		This should be kept where it won't freeze.	
	Put it in the basement until underground is arranged.
		Use the barrel at the washing machine spot.
		The washing machine was removed.
		Done.
	Fill it.
		It is being filled.
	A green house should be on the <a href="index.html#deck">Deck</a>
		until the Solar block is built.
Use a rain barrel on the deck with water being directed by a tarp.
	This gives water for the deck and for pressure elsewhere.
		Put the garbage can into service on the deck.
	Have it leak into the green wall.
		The garbage can hole was verified and marked.
		The garbage can was placed and strapped down.
This allows for several experiments.
	Use a sand box on the garbage cans driven by solar cells.
		The sand can be the lids upsidedown.
		No battery is needed.
	Test out piston or diaphram solar pump.

The false wall is about 3000 USD.
This is an experiment to increase the area out of the rain, 
away from the squirrels and create the greenhouse plant level. 
If it works, 0 degree C plants can be raised: citrus, figs, pomegranates.
The zeroth step is to get the first floor deck in place so that the 
area to install the second floor support posts can be reached.
	There are four areas to the first floor deck.
		The North is used for storing building materials that are 
		rain sensitive.
		The North Central is what was the exterior stairs to the 
		basement.
			This needs to be opened back up.
		The South Central covers the exterior stair well and is the 
		back entrance area.
		The South is an open area before the North entrance.
			It would be handy to get it covered to force the two step
			stairs to the perimeter of the deck.
	The pole to the North is the first.
	
	The decking to the South is the most useful for learning the 
	construction method for the decking.
		If it is a little ugly, use it to the North or North Central 
		on which to site building materials.
	
The first step is to get the posts to the right height, get the beams in 
place, and finish the East wall of the deck.
The second step is to get the plastic skin in place (2x4 frame with corrugated plastic sheets).
	This follows the in-house maintenance such as the ceiling in the 
	bedroom and the upstairs maintenance. 
		Should the damage from the weather be taken into account?
		
It is lacking people.
The project is closed down because of the move to Nevada - 2012-12-09.

Currently a membrane is on the upper floor deck.
	It is being held by the weight of timbers.
		The membrane is still in place even after a couple of high wind
storms
		2010-11-18.
	The carpet should be cut and spread out so that the deck can be
walked on.
		This was done about 2011-07-01.
At some time in the future the upper floor ceiling will become a flat
roof.
	It should be in the 3000 USD class.
The deck should be converted into a roof (garden).
	Four more support timbers are needed beneath the East edge.
		Depending on bolts installed by an incompetent into a stick
built 
		wall is asking for it.
		They should be at (42,0,0-12), (42,6,0-12), (42,12,0-12), and
(42,18,0-12)
		This will allow timbers at (42,6,12-24) and (42,18,12-24).
		I need the first floor decking to get access to the wall for the
posts.
			Use the constructed 6x6 posts.

	The 2nd floor roof should not be insulated but still be 
	transparent and flat.
	The walls should be transparent.
	Get the poles to 8 feet with a slope to the West.
		The poles and baseplates are ready.
		Use a lot of cross bracing at the 8 ft level as the base is
weak.
		
	Get the railings in place.
	
	Use 6x8 frames with corregated plastic sheets for the roof.
		These can be made on the ground.
	The plugin idea is waiting on this.
		The roof idea has been abandoned.

This task is waiting on the first floor deck and constructed posts.

	Consider a foam panel rather than a heat source.
		Measure the temperature before and after a foam panel to see how
		well it is working.
		At 72 degrees F and an outside temperature of 5 degrees F the 
		wall temperature is 63-68 degrees F (17.5 to 20 degrees C).
	Make it pretty.
		You weren't happy with the foam idea, were you Flower.
		The wall needing covering is 6 ft wide and 7 feet tall.
		Two panels will be needed.
		She is happy with the tapestry idea.
	The tapestry/foam idea risks moisture damage to the wall.
		Go back to the blanket idea.
	It is too bad that I gave the blanket to the children.
		Get another one.
	This problem is being defined out of existance by moving the bed

A plugin is needed on the deck.
	This has been put off until spring 2010.

Several wall plugins need to be fixed in the basement.
	The point to point wiring is a nuisance.
		It should be a loop with taps (plugin with a breaker) 
		going along the rafters.
	A second plugin is needed to the South in the basement.
	Put in channels in the basement South and North walls.
		Investigate the channel options.
		Nothing useful was found so far at Home Depot.

The lock on the bedroom door needs work.
	It was cleaned and trimmed.
	The door jamb has been badly damaged over the years and
	needs to have wood inset.
	The striker plate was spaced out so that the door would stay closed.
	
Also a sump needs to go into the basement.
	The current sump type drain needs to be dug out.
	Get the sump to drain both sides of the wall.

Try a pipe around the yard with water in it to cool the house in the 
	summer.
	Use a water spray to dump heat on the air conditioner.
	
Also a bathroom needs to go into the West Basement. 
	Stool, sink, and shower.
	Use the sump pump to get the shower/sunken tub lower.
	Get the floor vacuumed then wet mopped. 
	Also the cement floor needs to be epoxied to make it easier to
clean.
		Get the epoxy.
	Use two 500 gallon tanks, one for hot water and one for cold water.
	Have them baffled so that new water coming in is not mixed with the 
	hot / cold water.
	Try a tank of KNO3 solution to go for a lower temperature. 
	It can be used for fertilizer.
	NaNO3 + KCl -> KNO3 + NaCl at cold temperatures?

Setup for computer control of power.
	Paul has experience with the Rockwell way of doing this.
	Current sensing, relay controlled breakers are needed.
	An arduino was purchased.
	Use computer control for load.
	Display the lines that can be changed on load.
	Use green when active.
	Use yellow when disconnected.
	Use red when service needed but disconnected.
	Display the external power service status as above.
		Figure out the load on each of the breakers.

Flower, do you remember my conceit of having a wooden business card.
	There has been an example in the top drawer of the old pedestal 
	desk down in the basement for over twenty years.
	Later, the idea was found of having the card look like a circuit.
		It should be possible to have it double thickness with the
active 
		components surface mounted on the back of the first thickness.
		<pre>
How to make a wooden circuit board that looks like a business card.

http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2006/03/02/pcb-business-card/
		</pre>
That left it without a purpose.
Now I've got the idea for one.
	Use it as a thumb drive.
		<pre>
The current cost of holding the 32 GiB backup on 16 GiB flash drives is 
20 USD.
	They would fit into a paperback book.
		Check on how to split the stuff between drives.
		The biggest library is <em>fiction</em> at just over 8 GB.
		Sorting should solve the problem with space left over.
	Currently an external disk drive is cheaper and holds the 
	original files at 36 GiB.
		I am probably wasting time doing a .tgz, a .tar would suffice.
		</pre>
		The conclusion is that the flash drive concept isn't worth it
		except as an advertizing gimmick.

There is not likely to be a business for which I need a card.

This is part of the <a href="../family/biblio/woods jay arthur/house/equip/house_styles/freight container house">On Engineering the Perfect House</a> project.
This can only happen in a hurry if the present house is otherwise 
occupied.
Otherwise occupied implies moving all the junk.
At least two containers are needed to move the stuff and a third to 
live in while the reconstruction goes on.
Do this in 2011.
The cost is a 10th of the cost of the equivalent house.
The payback is in terms of 1 year of the reduced cost replaces the 
Container House.
	The containers are available at a reasonable price.
	A garage is about the same price as a pile of parts.
	This conflicts with the 5 story tower and the 4 story staircase.
		The conflict was caused by assuming the need for a "below ground
		level" construction.
		There is no such need for dirt.
		Just stack 40 (or 48) ft containers to the North Center and 
		Northwest four high.
		The North Center will still be the utility stack.
		The first two floors of the North Center stack will be a garage.
		The next two floors will be 1000 sqft of living space.
	This could be done at 4015 N 24th 25x124 with an entryway on the 
	alley.
It is waiting on the sale of the <a href="index.html#fiveacre">Six Acre Food Forest</a>

The problem is that current housing requires far too much maintenance 
and utilities.
	The least expensive construction method is to use a collection of 
	cargo containers.
	The least maintenance and least heating/cooling house is 
	underground with a geomembrane over the structure as an artifical 
	aquifer barrier leading the water away from the house.
	With four feet of dirt - two feet dry and two feet wet the structure
	will be well insulated. 
	There should be two entrances, one obvious and one hidden. 
	The idea is to use a collection of cargo containers as a single 
	layer.
		This would be 48 x 48 x 9 or 7 containers (~2500 sqft).
	Cut the walls with a plasma torch. 
	Find out the cost of the containers delivered.
	Consider the container tree house as an experimental starting point.
		A container lifted 12 feet in the air between four trees and 
		then braced would work.
		Consider using jack legs.
		Use the Aluminum container.
	Consider the hollow container house.
		This would be 72 x 48 of three floors or 17 containers.
			Inside would be a hollow that is 48 x 32 x 16 (~1500 sqft).
		It could be 56 x 56 of three floors or 16 containers.
			Inside would be a hollow that is 40 x 40 x 16 (~1600 sqft).

	A book has been purchased on structural analysis.
		The <a href="../../../../business/biblio/woods
dale/precision/equip/autocad/">AutoCAD</a> 
		program is capable of the structural analysis.
	
	Consider using a dirt/lime/fiber brick.
	Check on what happens with a dirt/calcium acetate/fiber brick.
		The calcium acetate should go to calcium carbonate 
		especially if heated.
		Ca(OH)0C(O)CH3 -heat-> CaCO3 + CH4 
		You could get this effect if a 1:1 molar calcium acetate + 
		calcium hydroxide mix were used.
		Check the amount of precipitate and the composition against
		the equivalent amount of calcium hydroxide and calcium chloride.
		Ca(OC(0)CH3)2 -heat-> CaCO3 + CH3C(O)CH3
		Check the density change.
		Check the mix in water to see what the pH is like.
		It should be about 8. 
		A more neutral pH should protect plastic and paper against 
		degradation.
		With the inclusion of stretched plastic or glass fiber the 
		selfhealing beam should be possible with an excess of calcium 
		hydroxide.
		Get a cheap pH meter or at least a multi-pH paper.
		Try heating the combination to a range of temperatures with 
		plenty of time for the heat to soak in.
		Better yet use a short time so that the brick shows the effect 
		of a range of temperatures.
		
	Consider using a dirt/lime/fiber dome.
		This could be done by making a dome shaped mound.
		Cover it with the dirt/lime/fiber shell.
		Cover the shell to four feet.
		Extract the mound and use.
		The figures from above on strength will determine the thickness
		of the shell.
		
	Consider a combination of loghouse and container house where
	the loghouse is made of a set of 2x2 posts with individual 
	diameters of 3 inches to make a 6x6 composite post on 12 ft
	centers on corners and 2x1 on interior posts. 
	The walls would be of 3 inch beams between the posts where 
	the ends are fitted (inserted) into the post spacing. 
	With an 18 x 24 or 18 x 48 to contain 2 20' or 40' containers
should 
	fit inside.
	
	Consider the container ship.

	Pull the tires off.
	The children were not told of the this possibility when their 
	car needed to be junked out.
		They have another junker.
		Get a pad prepared.
		Get a junker from Carter Lake.
		Or get a van from the 24th lot.
	Most likely it will collapse from the soil load.
		But what load is too much?

		This operating system will be replaced with linux or given to 
		Jason.
		
With a year going by until the move to Nevada, this system is 
obsolete and should be replaced when Windows 9 comes out.
This machine was given away as part of the move to Nevada.
Done.

Flower, I'm trying to switch over to Thunderbird from kontact. 
	The native format for kmail (part of kontact) isn't mbox (which is 
	the format needed for Thunderbird).
	It does convert, one email at a time. 
		A conversion program has been located.
		It is in computer/equip/bin/mail along with instructions.
		Use the restore instructions to get the latest copy.
	The akregator does better.
		However, akregator is doing a good job.
		The problem that is driving this is having to create a bunch of 
		folders that already exist in public_html.
		This is a problem with kmail but not with akregator.
	The emails <em>can</em> be copied. 
		This makes the problem a lot less urgent.
Flower, it is time to get the bed into the living room. 
	I will reorganize the bedroom as a family room.

There are enough problems with whiperie that this one should replace it.
It is being prepared to replace 
<a href="index.html#whiperie">whiperie</a> as an F17 system.
	The F17 is installed.
	Now the public_html data needs to be moved across.

	Done.

This is now the main machine and no further work is being done other

	It isn't working out too well.
	Work with Jason.
		Give it to Jason.
	He has accepted.
		The lesson is that the scooter approach doesn't work for me 
		because of the lightness of the frame and the lightness of the

bars.
	Look up the details on DC motors and generators.

		So a major motivator to bicycle riding is gone.

The move to Nebraksa has eliminated the purpose of an electric bike.
	It was expected to be handy for flat land.
	It was expected to be handy for trips in the 2-5 mile category that happened 
	often.

It is part of the <a href="index.html#belleacre">Belleacre</a> project.
Buy an electric mower at about $450 plus an extra battery.
	This at best is a push on the economics.
The battery usage match $3.00/gal gas usage.
The unit life is likely to be dollar equiv to gas unit life.
It is quieter and buffers against gas unavailability.
	The battery needs to be at least a NiCd to get the longer

	I now have an electric mower powered by a cord.
		It has been stolen.
		None is available from Craigs List - 2011-12-19.

	It only applies to the root as there is protocol here for starting
	a new library. 
	</p><p>
	When a new project is created the configuration information is 
	stored in Plans as an .html file with the project name.
	It can then be used in turn by scripts needed for additional 
	protocols such as adding to the biblio index and system catalog of 
	authors. 
	</p><p>
	This is similar to but distinct from the 
	<a href="index.html#nd">New Document</a> protocol. 
	The new document protocol is to be used for an existing document 
	that is being added to a library or project whereas the new project
	is a protocol to create a new document with none of the analysis
	that would be applied to existing document.

		This is likely to happen when a library is split.
		Currently, there is no known example.
			So far on all library splits there was enough common

			An example is when the fiction was split because of 
			differing treatment of author, title, series into
