Assumptions start from the political requirements of the 
<a href="../intro.html#political">introduction</a> fleshed out to make
a project.	
	The anchor has been modified to simulate the description.
	The em has been modified to simulate the priority (term).
	Only anchors are needed for Completed.
	The term has been modified with:
		payoff (1Y), maint (HOME, AUTO, HEALTH), 
		tithe (TITHE), research (RandD). 
</p><p>
The above is true for all Future.
	Link the Future, Current, Completed to at least the capability for the 
	project.
	Tighter linkage will depend on the existing projects in the capability.
	Link the Future to the project which will release it.
	Put the tasks that are missing some resources into the Future.
	The writeup on each project should be placed into wikipedia.
		Check on any updates periodically.
</p><p>
Link the Current to the current task.
	If the task is on hold, the project is on hold.
	Put the held tasks that only need someone to work on them into the Current. 
	Put the held tasks that need other resources back into the Future.
</p><p>
After completion of the projects compile the associated tasks in the 
notes and put them into the Completed.
	This will end up being the results.
</p><p>
Working on review projects.
	Review 'Current"'.
</p><p>
Reread the <a
href="principles.html">principles of planning</a>.
For balance reread the <a href="The%20Plan.txt">The Plan</a>.
</p><p>
Plan the experiments or tasks as a 
<a href="index.html#Assumptions">series of steps</a> or 
<a href="index.html#Protocols">protocols</a>.
</p><p>
Establish the <a href="timeline.gif">project timeline</a>.  
</p><p>
Have the stuff below be a dump of the 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/~woodsj/biblio/Woods%20Jay/computer/equip/taskjuggler/">TaskJuggler</a> 
<a href="root.tjp">project</a> converted to html or text.
</p><p>
Calculate cost of expendables. 
Estimate equipment time and manpower. 
</p><p>
This should specify the ranking of problem severity as a 
<a href="priority.html">Priority list</a>. 
</p><p>
After completion of the projects compile the associated tasks in the 
notes and put them in the completed activities section.
	They will then end up being discussed and conclusions for the 
	future will drawn to start the upward cycle all over again.

I need to have a way of replicating the problems.
        </dd><dd>
If you can't solve the problem, the problem is the problem.
	Step back and rethink it from first principles.
		An example is worked out at 
		<a href="http://127.0.0.1/~woodsj/biblio/Woods%20Jay/philosophy/Woods%20Jay/notebook/index.html#predicament">Predicament</a>.
        If repeating the correction doesn't work, cross check your 
        assumptions and also hunt for new information (that would cross 
        check your assumptions).
		Are there qualifications to your basic assumptions you haven't taken
		into account?
		Are there rebuttals to your basic assumptions you haven't taken into
		account?
		Remember that it is the user of the project that is to be served 
		and not you.
		It is less embarassing for you to figure this out ahead of time 
		than to be caught out at the time of the User Acceptance Testing.
        </dd><dd>
Currently, projects are subdivided into three types:
	projects to resolve newly perceived possibilities,
	projects to fix existing structures (parts, methods) that are broken,
	projects to challenge existing structures for conformance to expected
	operation.
For a long time, only the first type of project was entertained.
        </dd><dd>
The sort order is by the closeness of the topic to needs.

Many of the current entries were future entries that now have all 
needed resources.
It is expected that the authentic notebook will be moved from the
main computer to the working USB stick when this is done.
If this is such a notebook, move any linked biblio entries from the
capability to the notebook and	replace with a link in the capability to 
the notebook copy in the main computer. 
If this is a new notebook being created, use the writeup in this

When a major task is finished but the project is not but still in 
current, the task is moved here usually with a year added to the name. 
When both the last task and the project is finished, they are blended,
the yearly tag removed, and the results moved here.
	This is an implied criticism that the project was over sized and

    This took over the Beginning of Period protocol (which was used 
    in the past for lumping stuff together for a week). 
    It is now the startup of a new project in an existing notebook.
    It applies to the root as there is protocol here for starting
    a new capability. 
    </li><li>
	There is a basic conflict in this protocol.
		It starts with the assumption that a new project is the 
		same as a new notebook.
			This is not so.
			A notebook can hold a series of projects related in 
			that it wasn't necessary to continue immediately to 
			the next project quite often because of the lack of 
			information what the follow on was to be and so 
			how it was to be planned but the later project requires 
			that the previous project be done.
			Obviously there is a dynamic tension here between the 
			use of project and the use of task.
			The tasks that compose a project can be planned at 
			the time the project is created.
	</li><li>
    When a new project is created as a singleton, the configuration 
	information is stored in DICT BIBLIO JAY PLAN OWR as an .html file 
	with the project name.
    It can then be used in turn by scripts needed for additional 
    protocols such as adding to the biblio index and system catalog of 
    authors. [Rework this as it is wrong in the details.]
	</li><li>
	When a project is moved from Current to Completed and the last
