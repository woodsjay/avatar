For scholarly work, each of the notes should be a triple quite often 
of one liners:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; margin:0;padding:0"><li>
<strong>H</strong> - The thesis or hypothesis. The requirement.
</li><li>
<strong>E</strong> - The antithesis or experiment indented by one tab. 
The design. The code.
</li><li>
<strong>R</strong> - The resolution or results with 
implications for further work where each would be a new 
first of a triple indented by two tabs.
</li></ul>
<p>
On occasion it is necessary to link to a date.
That will occur when the flow of work is intertwined between 
tasks/projects.
The task/project abbreviation should prepend the date anchor.
When transferred to PLAN COMPLETED there is less chance of conflict
with other projects.

Welcome! Welcome to your online English 1240 course. My name...

Welcome!

		</dd><dd>
Welcome to your online English 1240 course. My name is Michelle Oswald, and 
I will be your instructor for the course. To get started in the course you 
might want to start with the "Getting Started" lesson under the Lessons tab.
The Lessons tab is located up on top there right under the heading. 
Just click on it and you should see a folder labeled "Getting Started".
That is a great place to start. In addition, everything you need to know 
about the course should be outlined in your syllabus that you will access 
from the Resources tab above. It is important that you read through the 
syllabus completely to understand how this course operates. In many cases, 
it runs very much like a traditional course, but there are very important 
differences that you must follow to complete and pass this course. 
One thing that is very different online is the way you will be handing in 
your assignments. You will hand-in everything electronically, and you must 
hand things in on time. Deadlines are strictly enforced, and there are 
severe penalties for handing things in late. Make sure you note all 
deadlines ahead of time so you can prepare your schedule accordingly. 
Notice most assignments are due by 11:59 p.m. on Mondays. You should check 
this Homepage around three times a week for updates, added information to 
the course content, added required assignments, and general messages from 
me. Generally, I will update this page every Tuesday morning. I'm looking 
forward to getting to know you and helping you learn all about the process 
of writing and presenting reports. If you have any questions don't hesitate
to contact me via the Mail function accessed in the Communicate tab above. 
I am usually online between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. weekdays.
 
By this coming Monday night (Dec. 8),  you need to post two discussion 
submissions. Complete details of these assignments are found in the course 
content for the week found under the Lessons tab above in Module One. 
In the First Discussion you must write an essay about yourself (I will post 
one as well so you can learn about me too). In addition to the essay, your 
posting should contain a statement that you read the syllabus and you agree 
to abide by the course policies. The second posting is one dealing with 
plagiarism. The details are outlined in the Module for the week.

Applying Toulmin Logic
Because using Toulmin logic is a way of raising those questions readers may
ask, its use will make your arguments more reader oriented. Toulmin logic
comprises five components:
1. Claim: the major proposition or conclusion of the argument
2. Grounds: the evidence upon which the claim restsâ€”facts,
experimental research data, statements from authorities, and so forth
3. Warrant: justification for the grounds and what makes them relevant to
the claim
4. Backing: further evidence for accepting the warrant
5. Rebuttal: counterarguments; exceptions to the claim, warrant, or
backing; or reasons for not accepting them

Preface to the Updated Edition
...
  It was, in the event, to my great advantage that <em>The Uses of 
Argument</em> found a way so quickly into the world of Speech
Communication. The rightly named 'analytical' philosophers in 
the Britain and America of the 1950s quickly smelled an 
enemy. The book was roundly damned by Peter Strawson in the 
B.B.C.'s weekly journal, <em>The Listener</em>; and for many years
English professional philosophers ignored it. Peter Alexander, a
colleague at Leeds, called it 'Toulmin's <em>anti-logic</em> book', and my
<em>Doktorvater</em> at Cambridge, Richard Braithwaite, was deeply
pained to see one of his own students attacking his commitment
to Inductive Logic. (I only found this out years later.)

He calls it 'the Toulmin model'.
