The README description has been transferred to preface.html
For a summary discussion of the status and goal of the AVATAR project see it.
What github calls a repository is treated in the older code base as a project.
Each project is realized as an ebook.
Even older than that it was called a notebook.
Even older than that it was called a book.
The active projects are kept on the USBDISK kensington, a usb stick.
AVATAR is expected to implement a voice and AI interface over time. It will start with the ELIZA method over the glossary
in the project.

AVATAR is being created from an existing code base called linux.
AVATAR in turn was created from and kept in sync with an existing code base which is used as a template for all projects called standard.
The standard project was created from and kept in sync with the notebook project which is where the research on keeping 
notebooks is kept. There is a specialized script to convert from the specific format of the notebook project to the 
template format of standard.
