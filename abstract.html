<p class="goal">
</p><p class="study">
At this level the project is being stated in terms of the
capabilities of each member of the family and developed
by an interest in the capability.
Each interest is realized as a series of projects.
As each project (which leaves a notebook or book) is worked out a series of
capabilities is improved and leaves each capability as the
equivalent of a specialized library.
</p><p class="result">
As soon as subgoals as notebooks were reached a new one was started from
the freed resources. 
</p><p class="conclusion">
Each new child was a fresh start and as such there is no limit except in
the ability to cover all the ground that has been turned up.
