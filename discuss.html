<!ELEMENT results %inline>
<!--
The purpose of the right element is to allow the insertion of text 
from the notes just before the end of the results block. The timehack will 
be generated and added to the inserted text. It is expected that the 
text will be editted for clarity and flow at the end of the project.

<h1>A Discussion of the Results</h1>
<results>
<a name="right" id="right"></a>
<p>It has not worked out well to become wealthy when one of the family members is 
chronically ill. Never the less by putting small amounts of money into inexpensive 
property it has been possible to build up a nestegg and the tools and property to 
achieve much of personal part of the goal.</p> 

<p>However, it has been much more difficult than expected to pass the results on 
to the next generation. It is much like herding cats. The next generation doesn't 
push well and the lures that would attract have not been found. It is likely that 
this is a personal failure on the part of the leaders. </p>
